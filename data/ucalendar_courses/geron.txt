[{"notes": ["Antireq: GERON 100, HLTH 100", "(Cross-listed with HLTH 201)"], "description": "This course focuses on the challenges facing older adults and on strategies to promote successful aging. A basic understanding of the physical aging process is explored, distinguishing between pathological states/illness and normal change. Many physical changes and associated functional decline are affected by modifiable factors such as sedentary lifestyles, substance abuse, and diet. Education, environment, and personal supports also play key roles in preventing illness and accidents (e.g. falls, driving accidents, and medication errors). The course addresses the interests of those working with older adults, and anyone who has older grandparents, parents, or friends.", "intro": "GERON 201 LEC 0.50", "id": "Course ID: 006420", "name": "Aging and Health"}, {"notes": ["Prereq: BIOL 130.", "Coreq: BIOL 273", "(Cross-listed with HLTH 210, KIN 210)"], "description": "The physiology of human growth, development and aging is examined, with special reference to the influence of diet, environment, exercise and disease on the normal processes.", "intro": "GERON 210 LEC 0.50", "id": "Course ID: 006426", "name": "Development, Aging and Health"}, {"notes": ["Prereq: PSYCH 101/121R", "(Cross-listed with PSYCH 218, HLTH 218)", "Offered at St. Jerome's University"], "description": "Variations in the meaning and significance of death and dying will be considered from a psychological perspective, with particular attention to the contexts (e.g., cultural, familial, life-span developmental) in which these variations occur.", "intro": "GERON 218 LEC 0.50", "id": "Course ID: 006428", "name": "Psychology of Death and Dying"}, {"notes": ["Prereq: HLTH 101 and 102, or PSYCH 101/121R", "(Cross-listed with HLTH 220)"], "description": "This course will focus on psychosocial aspects of development of the individual and their influence on the individual's health and well-being.
