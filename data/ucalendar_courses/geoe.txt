[{"notes": ["Prereq: Environmental Engineering or Geological Engineering students only", "(Cross-listed with ENVE 153, EARTH 153, CIVE 153)"], "description": "This course studies earth materials and processes from an engineering point of view through case histories and problem sets. The course develops a geological knowledge for applications to any physical environment and provides an appreciation of the impact of engineering work on the environment. Topics include: mineral and rock identification, the rock cycle, structural geology and tectonics, geology of Canada, effects of water, ice and wind. Students are also introduced to the concept of geologic time, topographic and geologic maps, and the basic principles and tools used to determine geologic history.
