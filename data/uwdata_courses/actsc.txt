The course will teach how to recognize the added complexity of longitudinal data versus the univariate response data which is typically seen in introductory and generalized linear model courses.  The course emphasizes the importance of the covariance structure for longitudinal responses.  The students will study the difference between subject-specific and population-averaged models and how to recognize problems where one or the other approach might be more appropriate.

We will consider how internal assessment of solvency may differ from the regulator's assessment, and we will look at how insurers try to manage the insolvency risk using asset-liability modelling and financial risk management. Solvency assessment may take a whole company perspective, or may be considered by individual product portfolios and both approaches will be discussed. A substantial element of the course will be a review of some of the recent research in this area.
