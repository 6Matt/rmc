Greek and Roman plays, both tragic and comic, changed substantially in form and subject matter as they made their way from Athens in the fifth century BCE, across the immense Hellenistic kingdoms, and into the republic of Rome in the third century BCE.  Broadly speaking, fifth century Greek tragedies and comedies strongly focused upon Athenian political events, and explicitly engaged the historical figures, and socio-political issues of their day.  In contrast, comedies written in the Hellenistic period have been interpreted as a depiction of the domestic trials of a Greek household, a situation that makes no reference to contemporary events or characters.  In short, the comedies of the Hellenistic period are bereft of political commentary.  In the second half of the course, we will consider the response of Greek drama to Macedonian domination.  In traditional historical narratives of the early Hellenistic period, Macedonian hegemony and the rise of large autocratic empires are linked to the decline of Athenian democracy and the rise of 'individualism'.  Do the late plays of Aristophanes, and the dramas of Menander and Plautus, all devoid of socio-political content, suggest a civic body that is disengaged politically? How did the Hellenistic and Roman audience receive and read the dramatic characters?  To whom, and how, were these plays speaking?  Did the plays implicitly engage civic issues, or were they merely understood as light relief from the world of resettlements, economic risks, and ever-present war?  How do the Hellenistic dramas of Menander and Plautus shape identity, if at all?", "cid": "13022"}}, {"course": {"title": "Dining in the Greek and Roman World", "course_number": "635", "description": "This course examines the civilizations of Greece and Rome through their dining practices as depicted in art, architecture, and literature, from the eastern origins of the Greek symposium through the late Roman banquet.", "cid": "13034"}}, {"course": {"title": "Judaeo-Christian Literature and the Classical Past", "course_number": "636", "description": "This course will examine the ways in which early Greek and Roman Judaeo-Christian literature engages with the Classical tradition.

Droysen, implicit in his terminology was an understanding that there was a fusion of various cultural threads that resulted in an Hellenic koine (shared culture) that spread throughout the Mediterranean from the death of Alexander the Great to the Battle of Actium (323-31 BCE).  In the years since Droysen's analysis, scholars have emphasized the \"Greekness\" of the koine, yet the Hellenistic world was one where the Greek generals who split Alexander's empire were left in charge of areas with their own long cultural heritage, such as Egypt and Persia.  In addition, Rome became involved in the Eastern Mediterranean by the 2nd century BCE, adding its cultural heritage and demands to the mix.  This multiplicity of cultures and cultural ideas shows that, while the overriding cultural ideology may have been Greek, the many threads present should be viewed rather as koinai and not a monolithic koine.  This course will examine these and other issues by looking at the various centres of Hellenistic culture (Alexandria, Antioch, Athens, Delos, Pergamon, Rome) and seeing what contributions each made to the artistic koinai of the age.  What general presumptions and assumptions have scholars made in the past?  Are certain regions responsible for specific styles or do they reflect the styles of the day?  What role does Rome play as the eventual cultural hegemon?", "cid": "13024"}}, {"course": {"title": "The Sacred Island of Delos: Cultural Crossroads", "course_number": "644", "description": "This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the Greek island of Delos.

The students can approach this material from a philological, historical, archaeological or art historical perspective.  Using Delos as a focus, it is hoped that students will see the need for integrated approaches to the study of the ancient Mediterranean and learn of the important, multifaceted roles this island played throughout history.", "cid": "13023"}}, {"course": {"title": "The Hellenistic Kingdoms: Conquest and Cultural Interaction", "course_number": "653", "description": "This course examines the cultural interaction that took place within the Hellenistic kingdoms in the wake of the Macedonian conquest and the subsequent Wars of the Successors.  It uses both Greek and native source material (where the latter is available) to analyze the character of this interaction and the impact it had on both sides.  The history of the Hellenistic kingdoms, in the specific context of international relations with the native peoples dominated by the Hellenistic rulers, is one of both alienation and assimilation, of bigotry and acceptance, of rebellion and (often uneasy) co-operation.  The course looks at both positive and negative aspects of that interaction between cultures that was so profoundly characteristic of the Hellenistic kingdoms, examining both culture clash and, ultimately, the benefits that  mutual intercourse may (or may not) have brought to both sides.", "cid": "13025"}}, {"course": {"title": "Greeks and Egyptians in  Ptolemaic Egypt", "course_number": "654", "description": "This course focuses on a specific period within Egyptian history:  the Ptolemaic era, when Egypt was ruled by the Greco-Macedonian dynasty descended from Ptolemy I.  For roughly three centuries, until the suicide of the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, the Egyptians lived under an alien ruling authority of Hellenic heritage.  Furthermore, they lived and worked alongside numerous immigrants of the same heritage, immigrants who appear to have benefited frequently from the differential laws, practices, and institutions that favoured them and did nothing for the native people of Egypt.  Yet at the same time, a study of Ptolemaic Egypt reveals also a pattern of increasing assimilation between Greeks and Egyptians. Such assimilation was not solely the result of increasing mutual tolerance and respect.  Indeed, the history of Greco-Macedonian relations with the Egyptians demonstrates that whatever respect and privileges the ruling classes ultimately granted to the natives of Egypt were at least in part the result of violent Egyptian assertiveness, in the form of armed rebellion.  The history of interactions between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic Egypt offers an unmatched opportunity for the examination of the relations between rulers and ruled, of the clash between ethnic groups, and of the forces that lead to reception on the one hand and resistance on the other.", "cid": "13026"}}, {"course": {"title": "Roman Frontiers and Provinces", "course_number": "655", "description": "The Roman world was a vast cultural mosaic embracing the remnants of the Hellenistic, Celtic and Punic civilizations.
