This course provides an advanced study of the building envelope as the place where design, technology, building science, and environmental concerns converge. It discusses matters such as natural light and ventilation or the short- and long-term behaviours of building materials, and assesses the use of new generations of \"smart\" mechanical environmental devices.

ARCH 675 expects participants to be aware of and pay particular attention to the matrix of cultural, sociological and geographic extremes.  Participants are expected to be capable of considerable independent study supported by frequently scheduled meetings with the course instructor.  This course incorporates design-build experience, wherein the construction of proposed systems is explored through the development of prototypes.

What is taught facilitates an integrated design process where all disciplines collaborate through all phases of a project to achieve a sustainable design. There will be an exploration of software applications including the generation of landscapes and vegetation, energy analysis, acoustics, lighting, structure, people movement, air flow analysis, microclimate analysis and various types of three-dimensional modelling software, particularly, packages that facilitate interfacing with rapid prototyping and allow complex form generation. Rapid prototyping techniques will include laser cutting, three-dimensional printing and CNC 3-axis machining. The course format is a seminar in which each student will explore some of these technologies in depth by means of a small design example and presentations to the class while obtaining an overview from the course lectures and presentations by other students on other applications.", "cid": "11628"}}, {"course": {"title": "Digital Lighting Design for Architecture", "course_number": "678", "description": "The intention of the course is to learn to achieve design intent in terms of artificial and natural lighting by digital means. There are three componentsd to the course. One is lighting concepts in terms of colour and materiality, light propagation, sky conditions, sun movement and quantitative lighting analysis including glare. Another component is the use of physically accurate lighting simulation and rendering software. A third is lighting design and critical evaluation through exercises and a small design project.", "cid": "11629"}}, {"course": {"title": "Special Topics in Architecture", "course_number": "684", "description": "This course allows for additions in the program on a short term basis, and for the development of future permanent courses.", "cid": "10645"}}, {"course": {"title": "Readings and Seminars in Architecture", "course_number": "685", "description": "Issues to be negotiated on an individual basis with faculty members.

Each participant in the Studio/Seminar will complete a major design project  normally related to one of the areas of strategic interest set out in the M. ARCH Program: Cultural Sites, Building Envelopes and Armatures, Community Building, Small Buildings, or Digital Design. Projects will be presented in the form of a report. Sections of this course may take place off-campus or within the context of a formal academic exchange.
