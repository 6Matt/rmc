Her lecture notes read as novels, she lacked organization (notes posted late, long wait for exam scores, etc), and although she was quirky, the whole 'scattered' thing isn't really what you want in a prof.  3 MC exams, and a few opportunities for bonus marks.

Lecture notes were not posted ahead of time b/c it was her first time teaching teh course.
