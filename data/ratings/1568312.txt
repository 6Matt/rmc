A bit strange and takes some getting used to, but communicates ideas well and makes the class enjoyable.

Really easy to understand his lectures. If you study hard, the tests aren't bad.

He act a bit creepyish at first and had a low voice but he's really cool and people actually clap for him at the end of his lectures. His test are hard though and it's hard to study for them, even if you'v done the readings and attend all his lectures (well for me anyways)..amazing prof still!", "date": "9/13/11", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "18997296", "r_easy": "2", "class": "psych101", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Very clear in lecturing, overall format of things is good. However, is slightly biased and tests are hard in being all MC. That'd be a good thing depending on personal strength, but with psych, it's hard to not be able to justify an answer when all the MC options sound right. Keep up with readings and actually attend lectures and you'll be fine.", "date": "9/12/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18993072", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PSYCH101", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Horrible prof. Lectures seemed to be informative but a final conclusion was never reached, when referenced as a question on a test, you were never sure what to put as the answer. The papers you write and readings are useless, you could write your opinion but unless it matched his you were s.o.l. = 50% :)", "date": "6/14/11", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "18730991", "r_easy": "3", "class": "psych318", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "I was looking forward to taking this class & was  hoping to learn more about the topics listed in the course calendar & various perspectives on them.
