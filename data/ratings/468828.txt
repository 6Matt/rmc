Half the class would leave after the break. Listening tests are easy too if you pay attention in class. I did not find the book that useful. Final was easy.

Highly recommend this course.  It's a bit dry to start, but if you work at it - extremely rewarding. I did not have the $ for the book, so I did without it.  I also didn't listen to any of the music outside of class (my comp died), but still did pretty well... probably because I was extra careful to pay attention class due to that lack.", "date": "1/13/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "16724616", "r_easy": "5", "class": "Music100", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Brownell is a great proffessor.
