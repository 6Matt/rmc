The text readings are extremely interesting and very important for the tests so make sure you read the material! Also make sure to attend class and take notes, because some of his slides are not very detailed!", "date": "12/31/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19647207", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSYCH261", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Solman is an excellent prof! His 4 term tests are straight forward. Multiple choice was ok mostly conceptual, and labelling diagrams was super easy! No surprise material covered on the tests, it is all straight out of the power points! Study the power point material and read the textbook, and you're set for his class!", "date": "10/14/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "19072497", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSYCH261", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
