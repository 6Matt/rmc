He speaks very clearly and he teaches well. He WILL put stuff on the exams that he says in class, and some of this stuff you won't find in the textbook, however there's only a few of these questions.Only bad thing is that he takes FOREVER to return grades.

HR is never an exciting topic but I found his stories interesting and they showed another aspect of HR. The trick to the class is to actually pay attention in it(yes I know its long) and to read the textbook.
