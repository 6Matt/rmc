She gives you the questions prior to the exam as well as the appropriate answers, however lots of memorization. It's strictly lecture based so go to her lectures. She's extremely passionate in her field of study so it's enjoyable. Would recommend taking any sociology class with her.

She gave the questions before the tests which was EXTREMELY helpful.  Only bad side is you NEED to do some serious memorization! If you cannot memorize over 20 pages of typed notes, this course is going to be difficult for you!", "date": "4/26/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18473540", "r_easy": "3", "class": "SOC202", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
