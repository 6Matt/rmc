As someone who was closer to the top of the class, I found he spent a little too much time jumping on desks sometimes to the point where it took away from the material.

It's the best thing you can do for yourself to take his class! He's clear and goes over the material with you in class, although it is from the text, it is really helpful and gives you a clear understanding of what you know and what you need to work on. One of the best Profs I've ever had, and hopefully I'll get another chance soon1", "date": "2/23/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16824526", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PHY122", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Brilliant prof. He has a sense of humour, and loves to joke around with his students. But above all else he knows his stuff. Happily stays an extra hour after class to talk about higher-level material.

I just loved this class.  Great demos, interesting diversions into physics beyond the course material.
