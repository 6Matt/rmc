It was his first time teaching at UW, but he was brilliant. Very passionate about the topic and classes were never boring. Offers amazing help to those who seek it and marks fairly. He sometimes allowed too much class discussion, but for the most part it wasn't much of an issue.", "date": "1/10/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19706708", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Engl251A", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
