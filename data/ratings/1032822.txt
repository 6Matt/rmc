Omg her classes were painfully boring and I dreaded every class but, unfortunately, if you don't go to the class, you have no idea what's going on since the textbook is useless. Notes are not clear and she barely knows the material she's teaching. Monotone voice, nice but completely useless. Exams made no sense. Avoid at all costs!", "date": "8/31/08", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "14788825", "r_easy": "2", "class": "FR197", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
