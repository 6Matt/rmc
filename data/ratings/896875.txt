Otherwise, a very nice guy, with a good sense of humor. Not very helpful to students, and sometimes he seems to be making fun of you, but you can't help but like the guy. Be careful, the TA and the Prof don't ususally communicate, which can lead to bad marks.", "date": "12/11/08", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "15161678", "r_easy": "1", "class": "HIST316", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Often hard to understand and rather boring at times.
