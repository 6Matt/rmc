His explanations are clear, his examples are relevant and sometimes the exact same questions show up on the quizzes and final. The more textbook problems you do, the better.

As long as you go to lectures and study for the term tests, the final's a breeze. He's extremely reasonable and adjusts the weighting if you do well on the final.
