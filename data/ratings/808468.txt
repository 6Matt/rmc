I'm not a bad student ether. I got well over 90 on the midterm. The course is very well established (cough by another prof) but this guy could be replaced by microsoft sam.

He literally reads the slides word for word and pauses talking in between bullets appearing because he has no idea what's coming up next. He is exceptionally arrogant (I cant see WHY) and extremely unhelpful. His idea of an explanation is shrugging (which he does numerous times during lectures).

A little bit arrogant, and seems like he doesn't necessarily know all of his material sometimes (ie. just reads the slides and rephrases the info, albeit enthusiastically), but his slides are really really thorough and explain concepts well.
