If you want to do well, study every single thing that was covered... not just what he emphasizes. Assignments are very useful so review them. Don't expect much out the lectures, but do go to them to get big picture ideas.", "date": "8/24/11", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "18947802", "r_easy": "2", "class": "BIOL208", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "The course may seem easy, but when it came time for the exam it was very hard.

His assignments are a bit challenging but trust me if do them with friends, they are easy 90+. Except his tests being all written, they are fair and nothing horrible about them. He even gives you the first questions of the final which are about 20% of it!", "date": "9/13/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17589359", "r_easy": "4", "class": "Biol208", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Friendly, approachable, and enthusiastic.  BUT very difficult to comprehend lectures, as he tends to go off track frequently.  Assignments are extremely valuable and will be tested on!  Dr. Spafford seems to expect a little more from students than most other profs, and unless you have a very good biol background, take this class with someone else.", "date": "8/17/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "17520696", "r_easy": "2", "class": "BIOL208", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Awesome prof.  His assignments are great, easy to do well if you pay attention.  Not sure why people hate on him so much, maybe he's just better at this class.

He may or may not know the material, I couldn't tell. I think his mind moves faster than his lips, cause he stuttered a lot and would just end sentences in the middle of an explanation. Lab was a lot of work, but can easily be aced. I don't think he's teaching this course anymore, so that's good news to future course takers.", "date": "6/17/09", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "15969399", "r_easy": "2", "class": "BIOL301", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Most useless prof ever.

It's impossible to pay attention to him. He never finishes his sentences. He mumbles too much. He tried to make the course interesting but his lectures were the opposite. Exams are all applications.
