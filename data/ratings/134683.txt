He doesn't put any handouts online, so you have to go to DC library to get them and photocopy them, which is very useless. He writes on the board, and sometimes writes for like 5 minutes before saying a word when class starts. His accent makes it difficult to understand him sometimes as well. Overall, he's okay.

The course material is somewhat interesting, and a lot of the content is algorithmic/applications-oriented (i.e there is not much tedious theory).
