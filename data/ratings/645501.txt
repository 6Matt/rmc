His lectures are clear/concise and are worth your time, although it's possible to do well from just reading the book and doing the assignment problems. Very approachable and helpful after class. Midterm was straightforward, but final was challenging. Course is fair as long as you keep up with the material and assignments.", "date": "10/27/05", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "10651180", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ECE309", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "He is an okay teacher, you still have to read the book yourself. The exams were made by Prof. Culham, easy midterm and impossible final. Avoid this course at all cost for all your ComEs. Overall course mark is very very low. The TAs mark the projects like thesis papers, so unfair.", "date": "8/17/05", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "10133264", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECE309", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Great instructor!  Enthusiastic and one of the best profs I've had while at loo.  We need more like him!  Approachable, and cares about students.  In class notes are at a fast pace, but he posts everything afterwards online.", "date": "7/26/05", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "10060106", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ECE 309", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
