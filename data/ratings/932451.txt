Yes. However, he really pushed me and helped me improve my essays. I started with a 68 on a paper and ended off with an 85. The lectures are long and boring but the readings were interesting and there are only 3 papers and 1 exam in the course AS WELL AS an optional sub. essay.", "date": "12/15/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19528928", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL344", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "I took this course DE and boy does this guy like to talk. There are 21 45+ minute lectures. Also, because this course is DE you would think you could contact him electronically but NO. This guy is so backwards you have to call the English Dept. to get his phone # and then call him with your question.

Thank the Lord he's retired - and should stay that way.", "date": "10/17/08", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "14878501", "r_easy": "3", "class": "engl344", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Great class! Wished there was time to include more authors.  One of the few professors who actually does what he says he is going to do and marks the papers himself.  No penalty for late papers, hands out examples of others student's good papers so you know what he expects, and gives out 2 tutorial cds.  One of the best DE courses I have ever taken", "date": "12/17/06", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "12627245", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENG344", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "terrible! this guys says \"um\" and \"ugh\" more than the average student! taking his course distance ed was a terrible idea and a waste of my time. criticizes everything down to the minute detail - i don't think i learned a thing!", "date": "12/10/06", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "12565563", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL344", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
