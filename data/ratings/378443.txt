Not strict enough. Not enough structure to the class. The classes never seemed to stay on track. But at the same time I think I learnt a lot and most importantly, a new way to look at the non-violence.", "date": "6/13/04", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "2244001", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PACS 322", "r_interest": "\u00a0", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "He is a great guy, just new at this.
