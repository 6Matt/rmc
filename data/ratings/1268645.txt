Singles you out in class if hmwk not done. Exams were not fair as they were extremely long and tiresome to write by hand. Students fear him due to his periodic temper tantrums in class. Overall not an easy going prof, does not seem to care about students' success or have love for teaching.", "date": "4/6/09", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "15612701", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ACC606", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
