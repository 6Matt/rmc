BUT, his slides are unclear, ambiguous, and often wrong. He also explains things incorrectly and has to correct himself (or be corrected by a student) several times in a lecture.

He basically reads off of the pre-prepared slides, but does give his own little anecdotes where he sees fit.  The group project was probably the only real 'useful' thing done in class.  He's worked in industry, and it shows.", "date": "12/11/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17911720", "r_easy": "5", "class": "CS348", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
