Earlier assignments were okay but when they tend to get so hard that, even the TAs couldn't solve it sometimes. Also, he talks alot on things which are not relevant to the course at all, the extra info might be very interesting and useful in the practical world but really, it doesn't help in exams at all.", "date": "12/27/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18047970", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ACTSC445", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "He definitely knows his stuff. Tests/exams were fair. Assignments were ok, with the occasional challenging question that'll make you think. You would've done fairly well if you tried. Very helpful during office hours.

He is very helpful during office hours and gives helpful hints in both lectures and tutorials.
