Absolutely brilliant and engaging. I loved his lectures. I understand why he seems like a hard marker, but it's because he always demands something new from students.

He loves to explain a concept or give examples about a particular assignment question AFTER we struggle to hand it in. Also, his marking scheme is non-existent.

Great to listen to. Knows when you're not putting in any effort, but is sympathetic to undergrad life. That doesn't make him a push over or an \"easy\" marker. You get the mark you deserve.
