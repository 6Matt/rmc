He showed a lot of films/docs. The prof talks rather quietly and is hard to understand at times, so sitting near him would be best. The midterms weren't hard and there is a take-home exam.

He does have a lot to get through but still. Lots of texts. The grading is unfair or at least disproportionate to the kind of class and assignments that have to be done.
