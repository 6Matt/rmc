Papers were pass/fail (10 total plus 5 more for bonus marks), the two tests were multiple choice + matching + fill in the blank, and lectures were always fun. Only downside was mandatory attendance: -0.5% from final grade per class missed and -0.5% for every two lates.

Take his classes.  Friendly, enthusiastic; he's a genuine human being.  A gem in the university - this man deserves a raise.
