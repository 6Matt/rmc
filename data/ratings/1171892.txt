Course was very hard and he taught well. His exams are very very hard though although u might think u knw ur stuff. Make sure you attend lectures cuz NO book will help!

However, it gets a lot more challenging after the midterm. And unfortunately, Saini does not do a very good job of explaining the difficult topics.
