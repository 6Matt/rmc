I ended up getting over an 80, and did not learn one thing about Russia. Lectures are pointless, just make sure you get handouts. Seems to be a nice guy, but is not challenging at all.

Unable to answer questions, instead told students to do the research on their own time.  His midterm was ridiculously easy, but worth almost nothing.

As a person he is very kind, but that doesn't change how ridiculously pointless his lectures are. He can't seem to finish a thought, and all the while, he stutters.

Sometimes it is really hard to get what he is trying to explain, but still he is great. Kind, easy going if you need an extension. Knows his stuff, but has troubles explaining it.
