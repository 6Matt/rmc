His notes are helpful. You get to bring a cheat sheet to the midterm and final. Assignment grading was lenient. He gives you the benefit of the doubt.

He's really nice and really good at what he does, and in fact, he made the final easier than the midterm after realizing what a total b*tch 2A is for all the SAF students. Just go to class and do the work, or if you're really good you can cram for the final.", "date": "12/19/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16601911", "r_easy": "4", "class": "AFM201", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Pretty nice guy, knows his material and pushes right through even tho a good portion of the class is completely lost lol (our fault tho, for not keeping up).

His 1 page notes are extremely helpful. Wish he would spend a bit more time going over it though. Very clear delivery of material if you know what is going on. Knows his stuff for sure.

Definitely a great prof to have for Tax part of 201. If he can make something like tax interesting then I'm convinced. Great prof!
