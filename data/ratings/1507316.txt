She barrelled through slides that she didn't prepare, told her TA's to shut up in class, wasn't able to run a lab without a TA and her assignments were a mess. They had no flow and the instructions for a simple question were very hard to decipher. Also blunt in person.", "date": "12/8/10", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "17891534", "r_easy": "3", "class": "GEO320", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
