Her teaching style is such that you should read the textbook before attending lecture to best understand. She does lots of examples and explains well. Great lady, really nice.

Course material is very easy if you have taken accounting in highschool. The textbook for this class was great! You don't really have to attend all of her lectures - just once or twice a week is good.
