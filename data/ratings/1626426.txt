He made the class very interesting. He is very good at explaining everything. I had done programming before, but we were learning a new language, but he made it easy to do.

Uses all sorts of funny examples, stories and even did some role-playing to explain the material. Would have gone for him again if he taught CS116.

Could have provided more examples other than what was in the courseware. He made up for it in the end by having two review sessions with great examples and then holding a nice review (office hours) the day before the exam.
