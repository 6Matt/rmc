She makes an effort to know your name and get to know you, and she sincerely wants you to learn Italian. Her tests are fairly straightforward. You get a lot of speaking practice- she sometimes puts you on the spot to make up a sentence, but it helps to learn the grammar and vocabulary. I would recommend her.", "date": "3/20/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16890450", "r_easy": "5", "class": "Ital101", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
