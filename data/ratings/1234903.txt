I'm sure of that. From what I gather, this was his first term teaching. One could really notice that he spent a lot of time and effort putting everything together - reading materials, lecture slides, etc. The only concern are Mey's presentation skills and his accent. He is very reasonable with tests and marks.", "date": "12/24/08", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15273125", "r_easy": "2", "class": "MSCI422", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Awesome dude.  Eventhough you don't have to go to class to pass, he is a great guy. Helps the class, tries to get the average to be at aroun 75 - 80.  He is not there to screw you over, which is important.
