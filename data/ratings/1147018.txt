The midterms are memorization-oriented and very hard to score high on since he asks to write about concepts from far corners of all the lecture slides.

He can not speak english at all and he has no experience in the field. To make it worse, he just reads off slides and does not make sense at all. Avoid taking this class with him at all costs.

In class he just writes on the whiteboard, sometimes it seems like he gave up on talking completely. The concepts are not explained at all. To make it worse, the tests force you to memorize his notes and regurgitate. He is clearly unwilling to teach the course and has a very lazy attitude reflected in assignments, etc.", "date": "7/28/09", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "16072480", "r_easy": "3", "class": "MSCI421", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Very unclear in class.  Does not use headings on the whiteboard and is very hard to follow.  Draws diagrams without full labels and expects class to follow along with his mental process.  Likes to list lots of things on the board in multiple lists on the board without any apparent connection between them.
