He may seem a little uptight at the beginning of term, but after a while you realize how funny he is. Also, he usually does bring everything together at the end, even though it may not feel like it at first. Highly recommend any of his courses.", "date": "10/10/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "19059185", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL200B", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Amazing professor. Really knows his stuff and has an obvious passion for what he teaches. May seem like he is going nowhere with his lectures but he always brings it together in the end. If you are not willing to pay attention and do your work then this is not the prof to take this class with.", "date": "8/10/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18904202", "r_easy": "4", "class": "engl200b", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
