She says \"right?\" unbearably frequently, and fails to motivate the class even though it's a class on motivation. Tests are pretty difficult - MC plus short answer or essays, but you get a choice so it's reasonable.", "date": "4/17/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15668313", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSYCH332", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "La Guardia was too clear to the point that the class was incredibly boring.
