Plus, he talks for most of the discussion periods, so it's hard to know what your mark will end up being.

Allows extensions for his assignments. His lectures were a little unlcear as he jumps from one topic to another and speaks without notes; but the work wasn't too bad a book review, essay and take home exam. He is really interested in what he is speaking aobut so by extension you become interested.
