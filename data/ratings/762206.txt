His wordings and choices in the MC questions are confusing people. Although buying textbook is not required, I think the textbook explains so well. You are required to go to class in order to gain the clicker marks. His voice is tedious, but sometimes he makes fun base on the materials.

In many cases, you almost have to because his powerpoint \"notes\" are barebones. Good idea, horrible execution. He speaks in a monotone voice, mumbles, and goes on tangents.

I guess it sucked that he didn't put notes on the web, but in my opinion it just makes ppl pay attention.  Which isnt a bad thing.  I thought he was a nice guy.
