It's so sad that she's left UW. I disagree with the first reviewer and believe that her expectations were crystal clear. I don't think I have ever been so engaged in a class before. If you have a chance to have her as a prof at her new institution in California, then definitely take her class.", "date": "9/8/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18986271", "r_easy": "2", "class": "SPCOM223", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I completely disagree.  Sarah is an amazing instructor and a wonderful person. She's extremely easy to talk to if you are having concerns and brings an interesting perspective to the courses she teaches. I feel very comfortable participating in her class.  You receive the benefits of what you put into her courses.

On top of that, she has no background in SPCOM and simply became a professor because her husband is one.
