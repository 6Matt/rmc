Truly has the attitude that I wish every professor had.  Openly jokes with the class, and encourages discussion.  If you look confused, she'll come right over.  Tough course, and she makes you work hard, but  you'll come out of the course with a solid understanding of FEA.

Does not give you a step by step procedure to follow, like many do, but gives you the knowledge to figure it out yourself.
