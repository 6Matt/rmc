Ihab is very nice and explains things very well. Definitely better than other db profs like Weddle and Chan. He is also willing to give away hints for the exams.

Sometimes his explanations are difficult to understand. Offers URAs to interested students and gives real examples from his research. Seems to be very tough on his students though.
