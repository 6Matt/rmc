The teaching style makes you want to attend class everyday, she knows how to engage students.The 1st month is usually a bit tense, but dies down later. She channels textbook material very well to assignments and real world scenarios! I recommend Dr. Minna's class...she is gorgeous:)", "date": "4/4/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "20000814", "r_easy": "4", "class": "MSCI760", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
