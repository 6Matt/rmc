She tends to make easy things more complicated than they need to be. She does not know her material very well and relies on a textbook fraught with errors. At least she gives out high marks on midterms/finals, but certainly not on assignments.", "date": "4/15/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21536910", "r_easy": "2", "class": "CHE 230", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Ariel is the least helpful person I have ever encountered. She misinterprets questions and never answers your question that you asked. She evades questions and doesn't appear to fully understand the course material. She also copies and pastes the same obvious mistakes from the textbook which makes it very difficult to know what is correct.", "date": "2/18/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21349204", "r_easy": "2", "class": "CHE200", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Lectures are mostly regurgitations of content taken from other professors. Explanations are unclear and lacks preparation. Cannot handle criticism despite her expressing the will to accept feedback from students.
