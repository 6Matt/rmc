When he teaches literature he is in his element: he opens up the class to discussion and makes us think critically about the material. He is a hard marker and will admit that, but he is also willing to sit down with you and explain in simple terms what you need to do to succeed.

One of my best profs! He is funny, and very passionate about his work. He marks the essays fairly liberally but attending class is deffinately worth it - if you do minimal studying is involved.
