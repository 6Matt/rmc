Like teaching for high school students, wrote everything on the board, no notes posted online. Readings are necessary, class attendance not so much. Easy class but all interest was sucked from it. Not strong lecturer, fumbled on explanations.", "date": "6/11/11", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "18721729", "r_easy": "5", "class": "geog209", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
