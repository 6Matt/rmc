Had some rude remarks made me not like him very much. Very strict, found him unhelpful and found that he changes his word all the time. COuld screw you over if you aren't careful.

There is a lot of content, so the exams/midterms are somewhat difficult, but if you pay attention and read the textbook, you will do fine. Participation quizzes in his class were definitely mark boosters! loved him!", "date": "7/23/08", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "14681704", "r_easy": "4", "class": "geog102", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "One of the gems waterloo has.  He really cares about his students and knows how to teach.  He is extremely smart and helpful.  His classes are a bit tough mainly because of the topic.  Labs due every week kinda sucked but they could have been a lot worse.  Nice guy to know and talk to even if your not in his class", "date": "11/29/06", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "12488392", "r_easy": "2", "class": "Geog376", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
