He is the best teacher, I ever had in life. His outlook is that of a professional, who has 100% over his job.

He's extremely rude and arrogant. He is passionate about what he does but he's very unorganized and really just a bad professor.

Lectures are a joke and waste of time. I see he has never actually published a book! Given how long he has been an academic, this is really pathetic.
