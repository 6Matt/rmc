Wrote very few notes, did not post his personal notes, and the textbook did not follow the course so if you missed a class or even a sentence you were pretty much screwed...also he doesn't give midterms back! Good prof though, he works in the insurance business so he knows what he's talking about.", "date": "1/5/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19678033", "r_easy": "3", "class": "MTHEL131", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "He is so professional!!
