The course is easy overall, it's just pure memorization. Listen in class and memorize the notes and the important pts she mentions in class and it's a easy mark. She's also very easy on the eyes", "date": "12/15/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17945575", "r_easy": "4", "class": "Anth101", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Amazing prof, certainly knows her stuff. Very easy to listen too and makes her lectures interesting. Fair exams, though the textbook is not needed.

Her first year teaching and she did fantastic. She knows what she is talking about, is extremely helpful to students, and gives clues for midterms. She is really cute acting as well.
