In the 3 hour class he would talk about the contents of the book, his thoughts on it and his experiences. I found him to be very interesting and truly enlightening. You learn a lot that I feel is more relevant. The exam is brutal and it depends on the TA.

Three different tests throughout the term consisting of 4 essay questions; 2 pages for the first three, and 4 pages for the last question.  10 pages worth of essays to be written in a narrow 2.5 hour time constraint.  The TAs marked brutally.
