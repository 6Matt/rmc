The book was easy to follow. Midterms were hell but I think he felt bad so final was easier than the textbook examples.  Loved learning Poisson process, easiest stat for me to understand. Recommend only if your down to learn every word he teaches", "date": "12/13/13", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "22535774", "r_easy": "3", "class": "STAT 333", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "When introducing addition, kids should not have access to calculators - they would learn nothing then. The theory is infinitely more important then getting the answers. Similarly, in this introduction to stochastic processes, the emphasis should be on the theory, and that is where Prof. Lysy put it. His delivery was raw, but still above average IMO", "date": "8/10/13", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "22043011", "r_easy": "2", "class": "STAT 333", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Very helpful and fairly easy to understand if you speak with him during office hours! Lectures are harder to follow because he keeps them highly theoretical and is a bit unorganized. Assignments are really hard as they strive to connect course content to other, higher, statistics topics. He aims to challenge students, but his testing is fair.", "date": "6/26/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21926178", "r_easy": "1", "class": "STAT 333", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I think he is a very smart person. The materials he taught are kinda hard, but was quite interesting to learn those hard/weird proofs/technique. This was his first class, I believe he will get better in teaching in the future.(He never get mad to students, I am not sure why ppl said like that) If you like challenging lectures, this is it!", "date": "4/21/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21573585", "r_easy": "1", "class": "Stat 333", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Martin is a very nice and knowledgeable professor.

The lectures are very difficult to follow as they are very theoretical, so looking back on your notes is pretty much useless in terms of solving problems. The assignments were also time-consuming, and many questions would just end up being bonus.

But if you want to learn more about stats, you will learn alot from his class. I don't think he gets mad when students don't understand what he is talking about, on the other hand, I think he is a very knowledgeable prof, and willing to help students succeed in this course.", "date": "4/17/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21550742", "r_easy": "1", "class": "STAT333", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "This is a not easy course, but he makes it extremely hard. The assignments are not understandable, so was the midterm. I haven't done the final yet. He gets mad at the class cuz nobody understands what he's saying.

Makes very easy concepts complicated, introduces random stuff that's totally irrelevant. Exams are ridiculous as he tests students on things he never taught.
