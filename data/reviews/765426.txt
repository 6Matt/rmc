Very patient in his teaching, and makes even dull topics interesting. Seems to know just about everything (in a very laidback way). Truly one of the best teachers I've ever had.", "date": "1/28/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19780436", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL251A", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Ken is affable, kind, and wise, though his methods can be mysterious and challenging. Take his classes if you're passionate about theory & criticism, avoid them if you're looking for the easiest marks. A thoroughly reasonable and agreeable man. Quite a fine scholar, but understated and humble.", "date": "1/12/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "19717148", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENGL251", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I thought the class was excellent. By far one of my favourite English teachers. Sure he doesn't always tell you the answer he is looking for, but that's half of the learning experience; makes you think. I learned a lot once I was able to understand his style of teaching, I found it so enjoyable. He cares for his students too, which is great.", "date": "6/1/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18687516", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL251A", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Hard marker but clear on expectations.

Interesting lectures and subject.  Seems to honestly care about his students.

Pretty horrible, expects you to know what he is talking about, without actually teaching it, and rambles on and on.  Huge amount of mark was group work, but won't tell you how your group is doing, so you don't really know where to improve.  His says are pretty hilarious though - what a crafty bugger!", "date": "11/27/05", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "10991152", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL 251A", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
