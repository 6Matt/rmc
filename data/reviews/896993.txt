Shawn makes it entertaining.  We haven't talked about one Philosopher yet, and I don't think we're going to.  He keeps you interested, he's very animated, and clearly really likes what he does.  I would recommend this course to anyone!!!", "date": "10/4/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "12265754", "r_easy": "3", "class": "phil100", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
