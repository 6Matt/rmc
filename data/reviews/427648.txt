However, I think she needs to relax her diva-ish attitude. Sometimes I feel like she's showing off, though one must admit she is amazing. As for class, she's really nice when you're alone with her, but can become very critical when others come into the class.", "date": "11/22/05", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "10968625", "r_easy": "4", "class": "MUSIC 227", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "I liked her even though she could have pushed/encouraged some people (me included) to do more.
