She is so rude that you don't even want to go to her for help. She makes you feel so stupid. I don't know why she is teaching. She should just stick to research.

Blunt towards people who use cellphone or chat, but that's expected of a lecturer.  Generally a nice little lady open to in-class discussions.  Requires pre-reading.  Good as 3-4th year lecturer but 1st years would probably hate her.

It's an intro course and she was telling us if we don't know what the economic problem is to get out. She's spazzy, interrupts mid terms and is a bit hypocritical. I understood more going over the slides at home by myself than in her class.

It's like she speaks one language and she's trying to get you to understand and she doesn't know how to get YOU to understand. She attempted to make an effort I think.

Oh wait a minute, patients would have suffered from her arrogance, lies and ignorance. Where did she get a PHD? Is it that easy?
