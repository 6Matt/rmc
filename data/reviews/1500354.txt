Attendance is vital, but she promotes discussion so that you're clear on ideas & does fun activities to learn things. Her marking takes a bit to get used to, did worse on the first midterm but much better on the second & final. Best class I've had in uni so far, you get talked to rather than lectured at.", "date": "4/26/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21614916", "r_easy": "3", "class": "BIOL 457", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Great lecturer, extremely hard marker.", "date": "5/29/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "20360328", "r_easy": "1", "class": "BIOL457", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I still haven't decided whether I love her or hate her.
