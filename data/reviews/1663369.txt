I spent more time in this class deciphering what her notes said then actually learning.

Course was fairly easy if you attended class because she did lots of examples. Only complaints would be she often made errors and used values derived from MATLAB in class examples that you can't obtain  using an approx (gain/phase margin).

Nonetheless, you can finish the course on your own in two days by just going through her pdf slides. You learn nothing useful in class. Labs are LONG! Beware, this is really an introduction to PLC programming course.
