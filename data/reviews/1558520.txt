He is easy enough to listen to, and the material can be interesting although a little dense at times. Seems a little pretentious... Marking of assignments and exam is fair. Course could stand to move away from such a heavy fossil-fuels focus, but that is his background. Overall, good prof but the course could use some tweaks.", "date": "4/6/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18366679", "r_easy": "3", "class": "SCI200", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
