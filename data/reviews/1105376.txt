Nice person however and he was helpful if you asked him. Assignments for this course generally don't reflect material taught however (just the nature of analysis sometimes) so theres never any winning. Tricky middy but 100% straightforward final so they balanced out. Overall however, it was manageable.", "date": "5/12/08", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "14453397", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PMATH354", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "I don't suggest taking Measure Theory with this prof.  His assignments didn't reflect what he taught in class, and were graded harshly considering he said many of the questions were trivial.  He never put solutions online and couldn't even write up complete proofs in class!
