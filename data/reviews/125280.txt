He is not a great prof, but his strength is that he is challenging students and providing new and non-mainstream theories to consider.  I've heard a few RS students say only in retrospect that they feel his classes were great - though not at the time. VERY hard marker!

He essentially used major theorists like Freud and Maslow to legitimate his own loony-tunes ideas of consciousness, transcendence, dream analysis, etc. He uses experiments with terrible methodology to try to prove things about altered states of consciousness.

He is not a good prof and seemed rather condescending. He didn't seem intersted in his students and looks like a troll. Avoid if you can.
