He is very clear and concise and his accent is so interesting that it draws your attention. Class is a bit tough and he teaches from textbook and a supersite. As long as you do your practices online at the supersite you'll get a great mark!", "date": "4/11/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21523424", "r_easy": "4", "class": "SPAN101", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Terrible languages teacher. Doesn't even has his own curriculum, just follows a book, and his class is easy but he has mandatory attendance and uses a separate site for assignments with a 50% deduction if you're late. Half of the overall grade is attendence and stupid assignments.", "date": "3/13/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21408236", "r_easy": "3", "class": "SPAN 101", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
