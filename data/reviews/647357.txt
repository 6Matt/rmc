Really hard to understand but then again the course is ridiculously easy, gives you good marks for a bs essay and for attendence. Not really an enjoyable class, but you'll get a good mark without doing much, good deal.", "date": "1/28/12", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "19779220", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHYS480", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "He isn?t qualified to teach stat mech, he doesn't even understand the subject. His so-called classes are carbon copies of the carter text. The test questions did not involve problem-solving, all memorization. He either cheated his way through university or boy wherever he got his phd from was a joke like himself, btw he doesn?t speak Engrrrish?", "date": "6/10/10", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "17322513", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHYS359", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Absolutely useless, regurgitates the textbook in his powerpoints honestly who teaches with powerpoint... U can't understand a single word he says, but his course was a breeze, you won't find an easier physics course.

Not fluent in English at all, doesn't enunciate very well. But his explanations of physics are clear enough if you can decipher what he's saying. I usually could, but mine is not the majority opinion. Straightforward exams, but devious marking.
