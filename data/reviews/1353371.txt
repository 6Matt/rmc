Very casual style where he sits on the desk and lectures, or moreover converses. Engages the class extensively.  The class, intuitively, is difficult, but he does a great job of clarifying concepts and using real life examples.  He is very understanding and willing to help and answer questions.  Do your readings before class, it helps!", "date": "6/23/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18758940", "r_easy": "3", "class": "AFM271", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "he is an amazing guy!!! teaches close to perfect,, really knows the material, explain very clearly..his notes r so nice and clear, u dont need the txtbuk at all..i wasted my money on the txtbuk cuz i didnt kno how gud his notes were ><..he is also very nice and helpful~very gud looking 2 :P i love this prof!", "date": "8/28/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17556770", "r_easy": "2", "class": "AFM272", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": null, "date": "7/21/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "17437775", "r_easy": "4", "class": "AFM271", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": null, "date": "7/20/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "17434759", "r_easy": "5", "class": "AFM271", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Happy energetic guy.
