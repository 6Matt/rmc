Her lectures were unorganized and all over the place. Her exams were also unreasonable, there is so much information to remember and she asks minute details. Neither did she ever reply to emails from students. She certainly knows a lot of about what she's talking about, but she's just not professor material.", "date": "8/10/09", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "16107905", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ANTH101", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
