It can be hard to grasp his style of analyzing poetry (remember, the poem is not wine in a bottle) but he definitely expands your horizons and gives you different ways to interpret things.

His lectures were interesting but found it difficult to tie his broad selections of texts to a greater common theme. Only good thing was that the textbook was provided online.

Williams is obviously very intelligent (I often felt out of my depth), which can be intimidating but he's also very kind and can be entertaining when the mood strikes him.

Really knows his stuff and has an obvious passion for what he teaches. May seem like he is going nowhere with his lectures but he always brings it together in the end.
