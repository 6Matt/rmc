Exams are not reflective of his teaching because he likes to trick you with every question. Goes too fast in class. he READS what hes writing rather than TEACHing.

I was actually enrolled in a different section but sat in his classes.  Beltaos makes his own notes which are helpful, so you dont even need the textbook.  He's kinda funny if you listen to his mumbles.  Definitely knows what he's doing. You can ask him anything.  But he goes kinda fast.

He's notes are really in depth, which is good, but takes a tole on your wrist. He's very approachable, so go to him if you're confused; he's very enthusiastic about teaching. He was excellent with concepts in linear algebra, and even wrote up an analogy of basis and subspaces.
