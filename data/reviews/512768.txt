Also, the final is brutal in terms of the memorization required, but he is a fair marker and gives extra help.  However, most of the learning in this course comes from the research you do for the three essays, so if you find the subject interesting it's still worth taking.", "date": "4/24/07", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "13053515", "r_easy": "3", "class": "GER382", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "assignments were fine, but the final was ridiculous! giving plain dates on the exam is just evil, wouldnt take another class with him", "date": "4/19/06", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "11727908", "r_easy": "3", "class": "GER 382", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "I would agree that the way he marks has nothing to do with the quality of your work. He's more concerned with you writing every single important point. His exam is absolutely useless. It's total memory work, and he requires that your study WAY more than is actually on the exam. I won't take another one of his courses.", "date": "4/7/06", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "11674441", "r_easy": "1", "class": "Ger 382", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "I took this distance course with Professor Warkentin. The material is interesting,his lectures are concise (30-45 minutes each). Assignments are 3, 1200 word essays.He marks essays hard, but fairly. The exam is very hard, lots of memory and only 2 hours.Overall I really liked the course,but not easy", "date": "5/2/05", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "3763955", "r_easy": "2", "class": "German 272", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "The marks he gives have absolutely nothing to do with the quality of your work.
