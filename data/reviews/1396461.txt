The test questions are extremely fair, he doesn't try to trick you and he basically just looks for study findings.  I had already got a great mark on the midterm and he decided to boost everyone by 6%. Easy psych mark if you need a gpa boost.  One catch is that you will drown in readings.. avg 5 or 6 per week. brutal.", "date": "12/21/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19590380", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PSYCH350", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Agree with all your comments :D", "date": "9/14/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18999595", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PSYCH253", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Engaging professor, makes the material interesting.
