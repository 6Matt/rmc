But, when lecturing, his Powerpoints tends to have too many examples without actually containing the concepts behind them. He will orate the theory, but you can't be sure what you actually need to know for the assessments. His assessments can be frustrating due to randomness and small scope.", "date": "9/12/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18993100", "r_easy": "3", "class": "SYDE192", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Mabe not a teacher in class, but very ambitious and active in his research and teaching what he likes.

One of the few classes where you can sit back, listen and learn everything.  You will never fall asleep in that class.  Even though he hates the course he still teaches it very well.
