You will leave his class with more knowledge than any other course you will take. He is extremely dedicated to helping his students, and his lectures are clear and easy to follow. He is a difficult marker, however, the challenge of the work leaves you to gain substantially.", "date": "12/23/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19612215", "r_easy": "2", "class": "Psci390", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "The course isn't over yet, so I'm guessing at my grade, but this is the most difficult course I've taken. The good news is that the prof is really willing to help you. He's very patient if you go to office hours and will meet you at other times if you can't make office hours. He is really good at walking you through the hard material.", "date": "11/9/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "19203808", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSCI390", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Mark Raymond is one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet. The issue is that he holds everyone up to that standard, so he rarely gives out high grades unless you produce some extraordinary material. He's very encouraging, but don't expect a high grade in his classes.", "date": "10/21/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "19090835", "r_easy": "1", "class": "PSCI357", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Raymond is very knowledgeable, but doesn't like to give great marks. He had two textbooks that were used heavily throughout the course, and he seemed at times to just teach what the text says. Not a great prof in general.

I perhaps learned more in one semester with him than all the rest of my political science courses combined. The man is a machine, and a damn nice person to boot. Highly reccomended.
