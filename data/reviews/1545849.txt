He doesn't require you to buy textbook, but you need to attend lectures for notes.  Extremely helpful and always has time to explain something or just talk to you. The class is not easy, but what do you expect from 400level Econ class. He tries to make it easier and wants his students to do well.", "date": "3/3/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18247353", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ECON401", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
