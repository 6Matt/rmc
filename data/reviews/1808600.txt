There are a lot of assignments and tests though so be prepared to have time to do them (1 assignment and quiz per week roughly). They definitely get more difficult as the term goes on and rudimentary theory will only get you through the first few weeks.

He makes the more difficult/technical side of music a lot more interesting. The class is not easy. I had a lot of trouble juggling 5 dictation tests, 5 keyboard tests, 2 vocal tests, and 12 assignments. He really knows his stuff. But I should've taken this course when I had less demanding classes.", "date": "11/30/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22406351", "r_easy": "1", "class": "MUSIC270", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Terry's classes are soooo fun!

Does ramble a bit in class, but he does knows his stuff. Also, very helpful, he always stays after class if you need help and keeps explaining until you understand it.

Want one day when you have an assignment due and two quizzes one after each other? Then take his class. He gave a quiz and an assignment once a week, plus \"special\" quizzes every other week.

I have never loved theory so much.  I also have never encountered a professor in a more light hearted/cheerful/joking mood and still serious about the subject.
