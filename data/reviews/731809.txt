Lessons are structured and you always know what is expected. Lectures can sometimes get boring, but she tries to make it more interesting.

Julia works hard to make sure you understand and can demonstrate the material learned. There are many assignments in all the courses I've ever taken with her.

Absolutely fantastic prof - loves what she does and is extremely nice. The course had a fair amount of work (in terms of numbers, not difficulty), but she gives extensions. If you ever need help, she'll spend lots of time with you and is available. She's very organized and clear with the material.
