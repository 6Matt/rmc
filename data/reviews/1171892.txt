His lectures consist of endless equations with next to no explanation of physical meaning behind the concepts. His on-line notes are scribbles of yet more equations, lab manuals are posted two days before the lab, and no syllabus so due dates and marking schemes are unknown.

Course was very hard and he taught well. His exams are very very hard though although u might think u knw ur stuff. Make sure you attend lectures cuz NO book will help!
