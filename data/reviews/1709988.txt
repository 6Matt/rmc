His jokes are lame and rehearsed and planned. His focus for the lecture gets thwarted by useless babble that only adds to your annoyance. One time he wrote an entire proof in \"leet\" speak. As a student, I was very displeased at this action.", "date": "4/3/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21479174", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Math239", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Prof. Katz has taken my expectations of what a professor should be and blown them out of the water.
