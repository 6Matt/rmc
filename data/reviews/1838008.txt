She taught for the first time and could use work on her method of presentation but that will develop over time. She really knows her stuff too and doesn't solely rely on slides etc. Attendance was not mandatory though because the course itself isn't too difficult.", "date": "12/11/13", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "22512092", "r_easy": "5", "class": "Econ 201", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Has well summerized slides, the problem sets and assignments given are very useful. If you actually attend class and pay attention the material is easy to grasp! She truly cares about her student and answers questions very well both in class and during office hours.

Learned more watching a 2 minute youtube video than being in her class. Very hard to follow and cannot explain any of the concepts in depth or even correctly.
