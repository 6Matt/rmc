You can tell he is genuinely enthusiastic about teaching English. He admitted in the beginning that many of us aren't pure English students but if we leave better writers he would consider his job done. I had to write a professional entrance exam for pharm. the summer after taking the course and the course definitely helped", "date": "2/22/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21359640", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENGL109", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I don't know why everyone thinks the distant ed course is useless, I found it to be really easy and helpful.
