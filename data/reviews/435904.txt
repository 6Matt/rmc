Magri was an ok pre-prof. He is fairly new to the game & has odd ways of justifying what he does. Classes are pretty dull, discussion topics have no relation to texts, & he seemed easily bullied by the class. Very particular when it comes to MLA format. I still got an A overall, just remember to format how he likes.", "date": "6/19/06", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "12017048", "r_easy": "3", "class": "English 10", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Yeah. I agree, I wish he would change that policy, I took this course over the summer, and I have to drive 3 hours each way to Waterloo. I missed two classes and I was late for 2, that means 4% off.
