It sucked also because her class was the last class I took in Masters. This woman did not know how to use excel.. half the class was her excel updating; she was also NOT lenient on marking even though it was a financial ANALYSIS class and she had a strict marking guide.

Good use of IClickers also. My only real issue with her was her reliance on the textbook key for determining whether or not an assignment/test answer was up to par. Marking should've been a bit more flexible since it's an analysis course.Good overall.", "date": "7/26/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18853464", "r_easy": "2", "class": "AFM492", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
