Course is challenging but he's very helpful. I emailed him a couple of times and he responded with clarifications on a couple of points. He was the ideal teacher, gave you just enough help to set you on your way and just enough freedom to decide where you want to go. This course is not easy but he made it understandable.", "date": "12/5/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17862808", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ENGL309A", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Has a tendency to go off on tangents and the material is VERY dry but he summarizes everything in his handouts (didn't really even need to buy the textbook).

The course is crazy hard, not a bird course at all. He offers no help to understand lectures or assignments.
