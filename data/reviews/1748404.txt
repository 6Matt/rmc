Trying to ignore the filler words can be difficult. Assignments were helpful making the midterm easy; however, the exam was extremely difficult. Assigned a lot of readings yet only two questions all year came from the textbook. He was more interested in his case studies than teaching hydrology but overall not bad.", "date": "1/5/13", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "21213007", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Earth123", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "After years of bad professors here I met Rich Amos, a real man by any measure. The only negative thing I could possibly say is that he interacts with the class too much. I don't care what my classmate's think hydrology is, so asking them is a waste of time. The assignments are easy to follow and help understand the concepts and the midterm was easy", "date": "10/29/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "20748445", "r_easy": "5", "class": "EARTH123", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Seems like a good guy but his classes are boring partly due to poor oratory skills.

His class is really boring and his assignments have a lot of conversions (A LOT).  He's often hard to follow and assigns a lot to read.  Not overly helpful and tells you to go to the TA.  Mid-term was difficult, quite a few diagrams.  Final was brutal.
