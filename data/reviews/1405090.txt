Had two courses with her so far, this one was far better than the other I had. Her lectures are interesting and tests are fair. I enjoyed the films and they were very relevant to the course. Three small quizzes, a midterm, and an in-class essay. She also likes Betta fish which makes her awesome. Go take a class and have fun!", "date": "12/7/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19411065", "r_easy": "3", "class": "RS121", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Great course. Thought I wouldn't take it judging by previous comments on this site, but I was pleasently surprised. I recieved a 93, and I didn't even read the text! She is aweasome, and I would take this class over just for fun. Seriously if you are on the fence, take the coures, it's an easy 0.50 credit. :)", "date": "7/14/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18818952", "r_easy": "5", "class": "RS121", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Wow...I took this course as a distance ed and what a disappointment. She had questions on tests that were not from readings we were supposed to do (ex. questions from ch. 8 when we were supposed to do ch. 1-7.) Unhelpful with questions and tests are difficult/unclear. Don't take if you do not have prior religions of the east knowledge.", "date": "7/6/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17393516", "r_easy": "1", "class": "RS100", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Well, this class was not what I expected, easy 80. It had moments where I truly enjoyed the class and there were other moments when the class felt dead. The readings are awful, however, you watch some pretty epic videos. Also, Marybeth is pretty hot and its funny when she fails at working the VCR. This class was fun and boring all at the same time.", "date": "6/17/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17343631", "r_easy": "4", "class": "RS121", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "WORST CLASS EVER!", "date": "3/3/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "16843620", "r_easy": "4", "class": "RS121", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
