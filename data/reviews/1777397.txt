A bit hard to understand at times but she works hard to be clear.  She is very approachable and genuinely wants her students to do well.

Persian accent so kind of hard to understand  accent is hilarious! requires text book readings for exams (3 midterms + exam; no assignments)! One thing I didn't like - she lets TA's make up some exam questions which were completely confusing & unfair. Overall, she makes a fairly dull course very fun!", "date": "12/7/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "20982628", "r_easy": "5", "class": "HLTH220", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
