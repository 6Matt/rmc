Does not seem comfortable teaching. Her lectures are like an essay that she reads out loud. Even if you understand the material that she lectures about, if you do not reference a reading in the test, you do not do well. Overall, if you can avoid it, do not take her classes.", "date": "12/3/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "22427230", "r_easy": "1", "class": "HISTSMF317", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "She was unable to answer questions often times. Focuses on strange topics and sometimes avoids the actual important ones. I think the we discussed the Punic wars for a total of 2 and a half minutes.
