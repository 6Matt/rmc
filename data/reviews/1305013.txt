Does a lot of examples in class, and gave frequent assignments. The midterm and exam were doable but he's a harsh marker!

Peemoller is smart and very well-read up on the course, however his lectures don't reflect this. He is not an eloquent lecturer and does not explain his steps clearly to a mass audience. However, during personal appointments and office hours, he was very helpful and clear.", "date": "1/3/12", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "19657434", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PHYS241", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Firstly, he's super nice. Very friendly, in class and in person. That said, his notes are beyond confusing. He's very difficult to understand, and speaks too quietly, and doesn't have control of his class, especially the tutorials. The course feels really disorganised. He needs to update his teaching style. Lectures are terribly dull.", "date": "12/13/11", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "19496887", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHYS241", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Print off the powerpoints.

His passion for the content shines through in nearly every lecture. That being said, the lectures consisted of him reading from his powerpoint, which was often pieced together and illegible, making the class beyond boring.

He gives deep insight to the material. His explanations cannot be clearer. I heard his public speaking improved a lot over years. Those who still complain seriously need to listen and think..

I don't think he really wants to teach but is forced to. He didn't know what was going on with the other prof's PPT he used so he just read the slides as he went along.
