That being said, it seemed like he was going to be strict and exacting at first but he turned out to be a very sweet prof; he's just a little quiet. He was understanding when I couldn't drop my essay off on time and he still says \"Hi\" if I see him on campus.

Although McGuirk is a fair marker, he does not clearly specify his expectations.  This course is not a breeze.
