He clearly knows his stuff, and really wants to teach his students about it--  that's where we hit the problems, the teaching. He seems to know a lot of detail about the films and their background, but talks in circles.  It's also hard to get a straight answer from him.

Knows it all and can't teach it worth a damn. It was 50 minutes of him expressing how he wanted more time to speak to us... Most of the films were quite good.

The good? He's passionate, funny, and just plain adorable. Tests are fair and very easy if you've done the readings and attended screenings. The bad? His lectures are well, useless.
