He's so ridiculously quirky with insane stories.  He doesn't spoonfeed his students, and I appreciate that.  Sure, he doesn't give you clear-cut guidelines, but what's the problem?

His assignments can be abstract at times, but that's only because he's encouraging you to think for yourself. He's very fun and outgoing. Makes theatre a joy to be involved in.
