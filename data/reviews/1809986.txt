His notes and examples were plagued with errors, he would often ask the class to verify if he did calculations correctly. His solutions to his own assignment questions not reliable at all (about 30% wrong). His exams are not relevant to the course material at all. He makes them extremely long and impossible, our midterm avg was 45%.", "date": "4/18/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21559107", "r_easy": "2", "class": "MTE 202", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
