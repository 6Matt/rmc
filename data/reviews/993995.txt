There were a lot of things I didn't like about her... I thought she could be pretty condescending sometimes... and her assignments were really tough.

She takes participation marks by randomly picking people to answer questions. The assignments are kinda tough, since you have to figure out a lot of stuff on your own (she won't help you).

Lots of reading = time consuming. Participation - you're picked twice randomly - involves doing the problem, so don't fall behind in the readings and do all assigned problems before class!
