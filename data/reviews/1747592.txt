The course (and lab especially) are extremely difficult, but the textbook was helpful in understanding concepts. Make sure you go to class and focus more on applications rather than little details. Prof. Glerum is one of the better profs I've had, and she alone makes taking this class worthwhile.", "date": "11/20/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22355420", "r_easy": "1", "class": "BIOL 331", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "It's a challenging course because there are a lot of concepts, and it's very application based. However, she is an incredible lecturer, very approachable, and very fair. She does review questions at the end of each lecture, and she really wishes to see her students do well! She cares more that you understand the big picture than the tiny details.", "date": "4/18/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21558112", "r_easy": "2", "class": "BIOL 331", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "She is an excellent lecturer and extremely friendly. Very thorough and you can tell she loves cell biology a lot. Watch out for her exams though - they are extremely challenging and require a good amount of application.
