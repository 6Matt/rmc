She made the class interesting and really cares about her students. The assignments are easy and are meant to boost your marks if you don't do well on the final. The readings are interesting and it is not a traditional  textbook style.  If you go to class you can easily do well in this course.", "date": "11/6/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "19171453", "r_easy": "4", "class": "WS101", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "She is not clear on requirements for assignments or project.

Incredibly hard and unfair marker. The class is interesting, but DO NOT TAKE if you expect it to be a bird course. It doesn't matter if you have excellent work ethic.

Just reads off slides and talks about how men are bad and women are amazing. Limited view on life and reality. Don't need to come to class. At all. Don't bother buying the course notes, she never mentions them or anything. Waste of money. I found it sad that she has just an undergrad degree and nothing else.
