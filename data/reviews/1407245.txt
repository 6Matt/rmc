If you end up in her class, run away, FAST. She is one of the most useless profs I've ever had, does a terrible job of explaining things in other ways if you don't understand it the 1st time. Also very, very difficult to pay attention during class. Not very entertaining at all. I've been entirely turned off of econ because of her.", "date": "10/7/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "19052887", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ECON102", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Very good prof.

She teaches very slow, but very clearly. we're usually several chapters behind classes taught by other profs.
