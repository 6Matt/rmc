One midterm, one final.  Some quizzes, no assignments.  Although this is great, it makes it difficult to prepare for exams without having assignments.  All around, a great prof.

But Ting made it fun, and was a great prof. Humourous, tried to get to know his students. Analysis, methods, roots/error stuff that he taught has ended up being in classes such as calc and stats. Good class!", "date": "3/20/09", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "15550412", "r_easy": "5", "class": "NE113", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Love this prof", "date": "11/7/08", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "14957307", "r_easy": "4", "class": "NE113", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Coolest prof ever - funny and laid-back.", "date": "5/29/08", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "14537923", "r_easy": "4", "class": "NE318", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
