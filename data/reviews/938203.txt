Midterms are difficult. Final exam is still okay (it's optional). Her course schedule is pretty bad. She makes life for students really hard because while she provides notes from her lecture online, she omits some words and graphs so we must go to lecture in order to complete our notes. Overall, it's an interesting course.", "date": "12/18/06", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "12640085", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSych353", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
