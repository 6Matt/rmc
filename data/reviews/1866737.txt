He goes out of his way to help you if you need it and he always lets you ask questions in class and in seminar if you have them. Exams are hard but he prepares you for them really well. I really hope Waterloo hire him on full-time. He's one of the best profs at UW.", "date": "12/17/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "22584644", "r_easy": "4", "class": "HIST 311", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
