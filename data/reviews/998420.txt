However, this was still a brutal class some days (due to the nature of the material, not necessarily his fault). My only major complaint is that he is not completely clear in instructions or feedback.

What a great introduction to sociology. Great (and funny) examples used to demonstrate   concepts and the use of movies and youtube clips added a lot. It was a small class so there was a lot of opportunity to discuss the material.
