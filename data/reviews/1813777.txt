Goes over concepts slowly and makes sure that the whole class understands. Always willing to take questions and give hints. You must go to class as he doesnt post slides and tests are all lecture.Textbook is pointless although he seemed to think it wasn't. A little arrogant but overall easy class if you attend lecture.", "date": "4/30/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21633902", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PSYCH 339", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
