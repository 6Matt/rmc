Buy the book...read it...and don't bother going to class.  Not even for the field trips.  Prof Raymond basically read the old school overheads word for word...same info is in the textbook.  Also very unapproachable after class (the guy is on campus for 2 hours a week...) and not fair in exceptional circumstances.
