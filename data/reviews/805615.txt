If you've taken physics in high school, then you should be find until you start rotational mechanics. The textbook isn't mandatory, but is used for reading assignments. He wants people to ask questions if you're confused, but it causes the course to slow down and rush the rotational mechanics.):", "date": "12/3/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19372819", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PHYS111", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "What an excellent professor and an awesome class. This man really cares about what he is doing, and he made quantum super interesting. I wish I could be as sophisticated and handsome as Rob Hill!
