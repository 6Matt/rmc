If you attend every class, you will understand calculus very well. He use tons of example in order to help comprehension. In my opinion, examples are much useful than theorem.

Not fantastic. Very caring. Wants the best for the students. Sometimes hard to understand due to accent. I wouldn't jump with joy if i saw i had him as prof again, but I'd be pleased to know that i've got a prof who cares. key: go for extra help, he's a lot better at 1 one 1 explanations.

He was  a decent prof and I was more or less enjoying the course because calculus comes to me naturally. HOWEVER, the final was impossible.
