This is the worst class on the planet. So boring. I think I felt myself die every time I went to class. The material was completely useless...who the heck cares if knowledge is internal or not?

If you are lazy like me, all you have to do is show up to class and pay attention most of the time and you will do fine.

Teacher reads staright from slides and posts them online. Wrost part is she repeats everything 3 times over, and her examples suck so bad!!
