I cannot think of a nicer instructor at UW!  Definetely one of my favourite instructors at UW, her lectures were very clear and she was always available for help outside of class.

The course is still very demanding though!", "date": "8/9/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "12145665", "r_easy": "2", "class": "CS 134", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Great prof, really freindly...
