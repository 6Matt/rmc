Really cares about her students. Highly recommend her! The lectures in this class were pointless but interesting since there was no midterm/exam just 3 assignments (1 easy group presentation) and 4 easy multiple choice quizes (5%) based only on reading and  movies watched in class.

It has so much potential, but is executed so poorly. I found the focus on Mennonite religion was too frequent and unnecessary. There is so much more that could be explored with this subject.
