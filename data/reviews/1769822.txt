Thoroughly takes up readings, so a skim is enough. She doesn't always get through all the slides, but then she'll not test on that material, or teach it next class (beware, and bring last week's slides too). Not omniscient, but open to discussion. Go to class. It's way better than doing the readings.", "date": "11/11/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22292551", "r_easy": "3", "class": "SOC 370", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Prof Singh is one of the most accommodating Profs I've ever had. She has helped me countless times and answers emails very quickly. She genuinely wants her students to do well. Attending class is MANDATORY because the midterm and take home test put focus on lecture material (several digital sources). If you go to class and listen, you will do well.", "date": "4/17/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21549399", "r_easy": "4", "class": "SOC 227", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Does not use a textbook but instead has online readings which is helpful but the readings were quite dense.
