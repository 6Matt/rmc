The Prof. has nice presentation skills with loud voice, but does not explain concept behind much. He is rude time to time and the course material does not match with exam questions well. Giving a huge bell curve does not mean he is a good teacher.", "date": "10/23/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "22206651", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECE413", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "The questions on the exams, assignments and tutorials were not related each other.It is confusing what to study for the exam.

Definitely one of the most organized and clearest professors I have had as a student at UW. Very passionate about the subject and about teaching in general.

He has to be one of the worst profs I've had ever.

He explains the material well in class, but it's his friendly attitude and helpfulness that make him stand out among a great many of UW's profs.
