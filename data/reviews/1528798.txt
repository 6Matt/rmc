AND GOOD LOOKING! the class is going to be hard if you haven't taken accounting in highschool. This is very fast-paced class, so you better keep up with materials!

The course in general was like pulling teeth for me, but the group projects were easy if you had a reliable group. Midterms and final weren't too hard, but the time limits were too short given the detail of the questions. The textbook was not very helpful, so attend lectures!", "date": "7/9/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18803167", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ARBUS102", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
