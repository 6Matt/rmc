Professor is difficult to negotiate with and is discriminatory and biased. She leads her lecture with a PowerPoint overview then the last half is a disorderly class discussion. Most students do not do the readings so these discussions are very choppy.

I am a straight A student but struggled with her midterms. Both are worth 30% and final is 40%. Again, I took her class as an elective because I thought it would be a GPA booster.
