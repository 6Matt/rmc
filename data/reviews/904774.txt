Do not take this class if you're one of those people who believes that one opinion cannot be better than another, or if you are a relativist (boo relativists).

When someone asks a question she expalins it beautifully. She will respond when challenged on a theory which allows her to explain a concept much better. It is unfair to say she wastes her time arguing with mike. her arguing allows the attentive student to learn more and grasp the concept better.", "date": "11/5/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "12361171", "r_easy": "5", "class": "Phil105", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "No Comments", "date": "10/25/06", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "12315414", "r_easy": "4", "class": "phil105", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
