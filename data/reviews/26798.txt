Dullest person I've met. Easy mark, but it almost isn't worth it. You take online tests prior to every class to show that you've done the readings. In each three hour class, she only lectures for about 40 minutes, the rest is often unrelated.

Great prof, cares about her students and will help you in any way possible. It is impossible not to do well in her classes, all expectations are laid out in full and she explains everything.
