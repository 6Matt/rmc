Mid-term was difficult but the assignments were pretty easy. Overall the course wasn't too difficult but the work load was above average for a psych course.

I think she dwelled to much on her own work and not enough on the research of others.

Some guy known for being a baby yelled at her about his marks and she instantly made the class way easier. You learn a lot about the social implications of the field, but you don't actually learn a lot about research in clinical or personality psych. You just apply some basic methods to them in the first week.", "date": "4/4/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21486286", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSYCH 397", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "This course is demanding but also very interesting and the prof definitely is passionate about the material and cares about students and what they are learning.

This would be a great class if the prof stopped talking about her own research and helped us with ours. Far too much work assigned, and not enough material covered to help us with it.
