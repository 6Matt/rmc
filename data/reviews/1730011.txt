The professor is dynamic and knows his subject well.  He spends time on explaining the concepts of the topic and goes beyond the material in the slides. many students do not attend the class thinking it is too easy. but as someone who did not know any knowledge of the subject, i find the class very interesting and recommend", "date": "7/11/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "20483751", "r_easy": "4", "class": "REC280", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "People expected it to be a bird course based on the previous terms' expectations. The course has changed -no longer 4 MC midterms. It is now an essay, and 3 \"long answer\" midterms. If you put JUST 1 HR to study the slides the night before, you'll do fine.
