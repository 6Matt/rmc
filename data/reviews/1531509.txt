Keep in mind all students in my class were non-CS students. She expects too much from us non-CS students. Her responses to discussion posts aren't that helpful either. Peers responding are more helpful.

Assignments are simple and straight-forward as well.  The professor, on the other-hand, tends to over complicate simple things and has a tendency to get agitated when she thinks students aren't listening.
