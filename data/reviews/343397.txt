Assignments are graded fairly liberally but there isn't much feedback. Towler seems like a nice guy but he doesn't seem very organized.

Final test is based ONLY on the text so make sure you read it", "date": "1/5/07", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "12725778", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ISS150", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Easy class and interesting material, however this Prof is very unorganized.
