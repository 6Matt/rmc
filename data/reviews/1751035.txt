His lectures may not be the clearest at times but he always asks to try to make sure everyone understands.

He does ask the class if we understood what he was saying or not. If he feels that we don't understand (more so when its \"harder\" and \"new\" material), he'll go back & review it the next class. He seems to rely heavily on the textbook though (i.e., reiterating what it said).
