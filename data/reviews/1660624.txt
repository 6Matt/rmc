While the course can be tricky sometimes; that's not his fault at all and he does his best to make it crystal clear.  VERY fair evaluations.  Always available to help you out.

Always willing to help his students.  You can drop by his office for hours and he'll help!  Very fair with his midterms and exams.

Really cares how his students do, wants you to understand the material. I've heard in previous years it was very tough to get above an 80 in the class because Le Roy kills you on tests... Scott is very fair, course material is next level but the problems are all done in tutorial.
