Lectures covered simple topics very slowly, assignments were much harder. Final exam was at a grad level, impossibly hard and downright demoralizing.  Doesn't teach, expects you to figure it out on your own, which is fine, but introducing new concepts on the final exam is not cool.  Openly mocked me in class.
