He just writes on the board and gave his back to the students most of the time. He explains in a very abstract way and enjoys complicating the matters. Personally, he is uncomfortable guy and has an emotionless robotic nature! His course was one of my worst courses I ever take in Waterloo!", "date": "7/22/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21988109", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECE-688", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Awesome prof", "date": "6/13/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21891228", "r_easy": "5", "class": "ECE-688", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Write way too fast on the board and barely gives you time to catch up.That being said he does try to make things clear.", "date": "2/22/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21360437", "r_easy": "2", "class": "SE380", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "He knows his stuff. I'd say the exams are pretty fair...controls is generally a difficult subject. The final this term had a True/False section where you LOSE 2 marks for a wrong answer. I think that was kinda jerk-ish of him.

He's a machine when it comes to board notes; writes super fast, always get a hand ache after class...good thing he posts notes online.
