I thought she was a great teacher. Excellent initiative to help students. Course overall was very entertaining and informative; The discussions are the best! The course made me look at contemporary issues a whole new way. I put in a lot of effort into the course and thought she was a pretty hard marker.", "date": "8/26/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18955179", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHIL220", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "So far this is the worst professor I have had. I feel sorry for her, because she seems nervous while teaching, and I think she's really trying, but all she does is read off information to the class. She mumbles a lot while teaching and doesn't actually answer student's questions when asked.", "date": "5/25/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "17265505", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHIL100", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Took DE on my co-op term. Really didnt spend much time on the course. But the nice thing is you get full mark as long as you hand in the 10% assignment. 30% mid term is open book, and final is soooo similar to mid term. Consider it as a bird course.", "date": "6/20/09", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "15977800", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PHIL215", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Her class was really hard and boring (monotone & mumbled), and 3/4 of the time she cancelled our classes, and without prior notice! AND she wasn't there for our EXAM! Her marking seemed random, and she was not \"available\" when we asked her for help. It felt like you didn't have to be in class because all she did was read the textbook.", "date": "3/27/09", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "15574893", "r_easy": "1", "class": "PHIL100", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Class was boring, material wasn't much better. Tracy will always make time to clarify things after class though, but she's a pretty tough marker (unexpected, given that she's a grad student).
