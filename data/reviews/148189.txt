The problem is that he has difficulty getting his class to love the subject due to slow paced lectures and a lack of prioritizing of the course material. His assignments were fun, but were not very helpful with studying for the final. One really nice thing is he posts all of his old exams...all 20 of them!", "date": "12/23/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18032083", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PMATH360", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Overall a good professor.
