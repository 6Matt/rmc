Very interesting and informative lectures. Course requires the application of concepts, and she gives you ample in-class time to practice.

Yes, she is very unorthodox in her style, but honestly, she's a super nice prof.

Not your typical English department course, but incredibly valuable to any English students. Prof. Afros has a great sense of humour and really tries to get students to participate.
