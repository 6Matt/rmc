Yes, she is very unorthodox in her style, but honestly, she's a super nice prof. This class was a joke work wise (she gave the questions to each quiz beforehand), and I have a funny feeling the people complaining here didn't actually attend many classes.", "date": "5/31/11", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "18682558", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENGL306A", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "AWFUL! who ever heard of a linguistics prof with such a thick accent?  picks on her students & embarrasses them, if you don't agree with her, you're wrong. expectations are unclear. one student had enrolled in the class that day and she forced him to answer an exercise question, he had never seen the material, she still forced him to try and answer", "date": "8/17/10", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "17519768", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL306A", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Don't bother.", "date": "8/13/10", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "17509607", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL001", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Afros had a great sense of humour and tried to make the course material clear and interesting. My complaints: quite strict, taught us the answers to quizzes after we had already been tested, expected us to know rules that were not in the textbook and had not been discussed in class.

Not your typical English department course, but incredibly valuable to any English students. Prof. Afros has a great sense of humour and really tries to get students to participate. Yes, she will ask you questions about material you just learned, but if you've done the days readings and pay attention in class this is very helpful.", "date": "2/19/09", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "15473462", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL306A", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "She was very unclear on what she expected in her ass'ts& quizzes,she'd often pick on students to test their knowledge on newly learned content & if they didn't know were left feeling a bit dumb.
