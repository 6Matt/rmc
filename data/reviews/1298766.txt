It's not an easy grade, that's for sure, but she is pretty clear in what she expects and provides an outline for assignments.  She is funny and her class is interesting, but not easy!  Show up, takes notes, DO THE READINGS, and learn how to write properly and you'll do well.", "date": "11/12/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "22303783", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL 100", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Sure she is amusing and funny but honestly the woman marks so hard as if she has to prove something since she is a grad student, no one in our class seemed to achieve mid 80s and if they did than they kept it a secret. It was a first year class too, what a joke. The books are interesting, I'll give her that much.", "date": "1/31/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18197455", "r_easy": "2", "class": "engl108g", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Great prof!

And hilarious!! (esp. her policy on cell phones in class!!) She's articulate, prepared, and her comments on essays were really good. This other commenter obviously failed the class and is spiteful, because this class was great.
