Actually cares and is amazing at explaining concepts in lectures. Quizes during the term stop you from falling behind for the exam although not alot of time to write the quizzes he will belcurve them if the marks are too low. Exam was very fair.

The content of the course was pretty boring, and his delivery probably made it worse. The midterm and finals were hard. He owned a lot of people on the midterm by asking a lot of stuff from the textbook that he never mentioned/taught in class. He was a new prof when he taught us though, so he may have improved now.", "date": "2/24/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "16826486", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ECE354", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
