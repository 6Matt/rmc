Actually cares and is amazing at explaining concepts in lectures.

The content of the course was pretty boring, and his delivery probably made it worse. The midterm and finals were hard. He owned a lot of people on the midterm by asking a lot of stuff from the textbook that he never mentioned/taught in class. He was a new prof when he taught us though, so he may have improved now.", "date": "2/24/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "16826486", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ECE354", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "2"}]}
