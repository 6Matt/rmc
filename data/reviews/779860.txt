Using the textbook was necessary because going to class wasn't very helpful.  That being said, not sure why he was still given a rating of 5 LOL.  He was hard to follow at times, and not very organized.  The course itself isn't too bad, but having to learn it yourself does not make it easier.", "date": "1/21/07", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "12803447", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ChE026", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "we were his first class i think. He is a nice person but just needs more confidence and a bit better english. course is very easy - just partial integration through out.if you use Raffs textbook - you wont lose much not showing up on lectures at all. actually book is more interesting then the lectures.", "date": "12/14/05", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "11149603", "r_easy": "5", "class": "che 23", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
