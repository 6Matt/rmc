Probably the #1 course in my undergrad career. Provided you need to be ready to show up to class and learn. Clapp is a great lecturer and really tried to keep you engaged.

She requires you to understand concepts (not just to know them) and you will learn far more in this class than you will in several combined.  An amazing mark is completely achievable if you put in the time.", "date": "5/30/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17285646", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENVS220", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "interesting class to take after several econ, going to lectures and the tutorial was pretty much the whole course..we watched a couple really good movies ;)", "date": "8/23/07", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "13429735", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENVS220", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "She was a nice prof.
