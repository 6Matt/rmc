She gives out candy, marks super easy, and is totally creative. I felt like I understood nothing, but exited the class with a 98 somehow. She has the greatest fashion sense, and she's pretty good looking for a middle-aged woman.

She gives out candy, knows your name (well your given Russian name), sings, and is a pretty easy marker. Be sure to study the dialogues - though you're not marked, it can be embarrassing not knowing them. She lets us watch Russian cartoons and makes us sing songs.
