He is very fair if you approach him with questions and his exams are not too difficult (especially for ECE 471, which can be far worse). He is a genuinely good person who cares about the education of the students and cares about the course itself.", "date": "10/4/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17630397", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ECE471", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "One of the best profs ever. Has a remarkable personality. Patient with questions directed to him, great sense of humour, a genuine interest in making the course a good learning experience and has a sincere approach to teaching. Exams are not difficult, but rather carefully designed to test concepts.
