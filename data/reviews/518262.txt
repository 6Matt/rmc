Not the most exciting speaker, but he knows his stuff and cares about his students. I was very impressed when I went to his office hours and he knew my name.

There were still things on the exam that I'd never seen before. Not to mention his exam was set up so each question was worth 1% of your final mark. His lectures are deceiving in terms of what the midterms/exams will actually be like, and he isn't very helpful at clarifying anything.", "date": "12/23/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "18029287", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECON201", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": null, "date": "10/27/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17696739", "r_easy": "3", "class": "econ402", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Totally uncool guy!
