Good lectures, leads class discussions well. She was always aware of the fact that not the entire class was in English (or even Arts) and was sure to make everything accessible and explain terminology and expectations. Clear expectations for essays and exams. Good comments on essays. Provides good resources to help with essays.", "date": "7/25/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18849743", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL201", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Loves English. Near absurd amount of material covered. Clear lecturer, though she doesn't answer questions in class. Weird arbitrary divide between one tutorial discussion class and two lectures a week on different material. Made us respond to a picture on the final, which was tricky and stupid.", "date": "4/12/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16982222", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL200B", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "She's a decent lecturer", "date": "3/5/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "16851217", "r_easy": "2", "class": "eng200b", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Great prof, but a tough marker. She is very passionate about the course material and a funny lecturer (VERY enthusiastic!). There is A LOT of reading though and the midterms and exam are difficult. She leaves lots of excellent comments for the two essays and doesn't seem to mark them as hard as the midterms/exam. There are also participation marks!", "date": "12/24/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16637702", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL410D", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Didn't like the course or the prof at all. She refused to answer questions in class/give anyone a chance to comment on her thoughts. You only got her opinions and her understandings. The tutorial portion of the class was a waste of time. Doesn't seem to care about student success/confidence or if people enjoy the content.", "date": "8/10/09", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "16109077", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL200B", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "The lectures were decent and the workload fair. Very stellar, all 'round. One thing I did NOT appreciate, though, was her assertion that she would not answer ANY questions about the material in class. I appreciate that it was a big class and that's what tutorial is for, but this flat refusal to clarify anything in class was extremely off-putting.", "date": "4/23/09", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "15698877", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL200B", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Prof is nice and fun, but the attendance thing is a little silly.  Divides class into 2 halves; half is lecturing and half is 'discussion'.  Discussions are pointless, unhelpful, and take up too much time.  Easy marker but no matter how much you write, it's never enough.  Wrote on the exam for 3 hours straight and she still wanted more.", "date": "12/21/08", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15258437", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENGL410D", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Interesting! Combination of lecture and discussion made for an engaging atmosphere. Not an easy marker - you must earn your grade in this class. Approachable and helpful with questions. Gives two grace days (spread as you'd like over two papers), but strict about deadlines otherwise. Quite a heavy reading load - expect a challenge in that area.", "date": "12/14/08", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15192137", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENGL410D", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "No Comments", "date": "11/16/07", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "13669078", "r_easy": "3", "class": "BritLit", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
