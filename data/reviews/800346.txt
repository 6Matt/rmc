Tends to focus more on her own material than the textbook, so coming to class is important, but she keeps things fairly interesting and shows video clips in class.", "date": "2/14/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "16804347", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSYCH354", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Really nice prof, genuinely cares about you and your understanding of the material. Loves sharing personal anecdotes, which I thought was fun, but could be annoying to some. You can get a reasonable grade on the text and slides alone, but there's no reason not to come to class, since she tries her best to make it relevant and interesting.", "date": "12/11/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16532138", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSYCH354", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "She's an awesome prof!", "date": "11/17/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "16384556", "r_easy": "5", "class": "Psych354", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Interesting course overall. Professor Fitzsimons is very nice. She likes to see her students do well. She talks really fast, but the material isn't too difficult to keep up. Very few people skip her classes because they are always interesting. She also shows video clips as examples in class. Tests and assignments are fair.", "date": "4/13/08", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "14285468", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PSYCH354", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "She's a great professor - very understanding, sweet,and fair", "date": "3/26/08", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "14201916", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSYCH354", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "patronizing and full of herself.", "date": "5/26/07", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "13215741", "r_easy": "2", "class": "psyc01", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "I loved her and this class.

It could be easy points if you go to class but its irrelivant to the course. She expects you to remember her details and discourages critical thinking.

She's young, pretty, sweet and SO smart! She always put slides up on the website with relevant pictures and she even showed a Sex and the City clip! She's really easy to listen to in class.
