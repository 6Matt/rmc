Engaging, interesting. Added little extras to make the material 'come to life'-made pie,throw a ball around,play games,sing etc. He provides feedback on your work,encourages discussion. Only issue- was sometimes unclear what he wanted us to know exactly.

Not strict enough. Not enough structure to the class. The classes never seemed to stay on track.
