He is definitely one of my favourite profs this term! Sometimes you can tell he is a little uncomfortable, but then again this is his first time teaching a course. He is very knowledgeable and approachable. Even though I find the course content boring, I always look forward to coming to class.", "date": "11/19/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22349702", "r_easy": "3", "class": "AFM 131", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Nice guy.  You can definitely go to him for help.  You should come to class because that helps and you need to fill in his PPTs but if you don't, that's okay too.  Mike's Bikes is dumb.  Midterm exams are worth very little.
