He is very engaging and passionate about the subject matter and allows plenty of options in what you submit assignments on. If you show up to class, get involved in discussion, and post/comment on the class blog you'll get some easy marks. I highly recommend taking his class.", "date": "12/12/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21037249", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENG101B", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "A great professor whose passionate about what he teaches. He's one of the most down to earth and understanding professors around, and his classes were brilliantly interesting!
