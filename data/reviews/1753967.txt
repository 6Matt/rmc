His lessons were clear and concise and got the points we cared about most very quickly. Clarity was poor due to his inability to speak American.

Dr. Shim has a pretty strong accent, but not too bad once you get use to him.

He is so easy to approach after class, and he knows so much about life in general!  I look forward to his classes next term! Be sure to read the textbook because I think all his lectures are about noodles and geese. He is even on YouTube!
