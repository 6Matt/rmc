He can be boring at times and often takes such long pauses to try and find the right words that its hard not to laugh. Material is not too hard but you have to know it very well to ace the test. He takes time to build individual relationships with students. He's moving back to Isreal :(", "date": "4/24/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "11753257", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Psych 338", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Heller is very borring.  He has examples but sometimes he just goes on and on.  Also, he likes to \"not read\" off the slides, so he has to think of replacement words for every sentence on the slides, which takes him a good 10 mins per line.", "date": "12/18/05", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "11206050", "r_easy": "3", "class": "psych 338", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "He's a great prof in the sense that he's really tries to explain things to you and gives lots of examples, shortens the 3 hour classes to 2 hours, and he's there to help when you need it. Just make sure you always study his notes before exams because a huge chunk comes from there!", "date": "12/15/05", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "11173996", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Psych 338", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Very boring class.And He needs 10mins to finish a five-word sentence.If you have the other chioce, don't take this course with him!", "date": "11/29/05", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "11009897", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Psych338", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "He tries hard.", "date": "11/13/05", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "10895690", "r_easy": "4", "class": "Psych 338", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Not very willing to help.

The lectures were deathly boring, the exams unfair and overall useless. Most people who take Organizational Behaviour are required to and are not necessarily psych majors.

First, he won't put his notes up on the net, and PAUSES DURING LECTURE to allow people to copy, thus stretching a 2 hour lecture into a 3.
