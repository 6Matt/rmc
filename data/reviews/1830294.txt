I wouldn't blame her in particular, I'm sure she's doing her best. The course staff in general were very disorganized. For example, Daniela's section didn't cover box notation like the other sections did. The final exam used exclusively box notation which confused a lot of students. CS245 needs some serious restructuring..", "date": "12/15/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "22559292", "r_easy": "1", "class": "CS245", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "inexperienced", "date": "12/12/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "22531634", "r_easy": "1", "class": "CS 245", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "She's very kind, and willing help.
