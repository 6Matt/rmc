However I found the class to be a lot more than I expected in terms of difficulty. The readings can be pretty boring. I'm finding that the multiple choice section on exams are hard. It's nice that she gives the exam essay questions before hand and gives some hints as to what she is looking for.", "date": "11/14/05", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "10904033", "r_easy": "3", "class": "RS 100D", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "She is a very good professor.
