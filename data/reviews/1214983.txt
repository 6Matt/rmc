Lectures are very clear and well organized. Very knowledgeable. The readings are a bit heavy: 4 200+ pg books that are mandatory for midterm, paper, exam and discussion. Discussion is 4% bonus if attend and -10% if you don't. Fair marker just go to lecture and sort of regurgitate it on midterm/final. Recording the lectures helped me.", "date": "4/30/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21633928", "r_easy": "4", "class": "HIST 258", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Very nice guy, though a bit aloof. Looks like a big teddy bear and sips from his waterbottle through a straw. Good lecturer, highly knowledgeable about American history especially. Makes lame jokes, but I think he knows they are lame. Pretty tough grader, but fair. Plays rec basketball and has a killer 3-ball, beware appearances are decieving!", "date": "2/6/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21325477", "r_easy": "3", "class": "HIS315", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "An okay class; the material was interesting at some points, but it was mainly quite dull. He showed a lot of films/docs. The prof talks rather quietly and is hard to understand at times, so sitting near him would be best. The midterms weren't hard and there is a take-home exam. Textbooks are required in this class.", "date": "4/20/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "18442465", "r_easy": "4", "class": "HIST220", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Very boring and dull.

He does have a lot to get through but still. Lots of texts. The grading is unfair or at least disproportionate to the kind of class and assignments that have to be done.
