However, her powerpoint slides do not have enough information on them, as she just talks about it in lectures and expects you to write everything down. A bit unfair, as the other prof for the same class provides information on his slides.

Will never say no to a question. You kinda have to use her lecture notes in conjunction with the lecture notes but that's not to say that her notes are bad.
