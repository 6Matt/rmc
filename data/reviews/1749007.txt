However, he is extremely helpful if you seek it out and have questions. It's pretty clear that he does care about his students but he's just new to lecturing - that's more  than can be said for many profs. Our midterm was too fast paced, but he made the final extremely straight forward.", "date": "12/21/12", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "21148951", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CS230", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Course is required, but do not take it in the Fall so you avoid this prof.
