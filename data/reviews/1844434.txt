He teaches from the book a lot when introducing concepts, but only provides a minimal number of examples. Read the textbook at the end of each lecture and do practice Q's. He's extremely helpful during office hours, so it makes up for his super quick lectures. Easy to talk to and approachable. Should consider showing more examples.", "date": "10/25/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "22214242", "r_easy": "3", "class": "MATH127", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
