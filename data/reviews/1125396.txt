He goes through material quite slowly, so it's easy to follow, but may put you to sleep. Really nice, helpful guy, who really puts some effort into his teaching. Slow pace largely the fault of the course (content-light). Clear (if slow) lectures; helpful out of class. (CO350 is fairly easy.)", "date": "4/21/08", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "14325918", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CO350", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
