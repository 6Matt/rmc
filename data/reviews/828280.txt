He was a very interesting prof who taught with energy.  My friends and I loved it.  He took time to respond to email but was always willing to meet to help in the assignments.  I'd definitely recommend it to people who want to learn.

I was very unimpressed, and believe that he has been unfair in his marking when compato his teaching. There was little guidance on essays. Expectations were huge for a 2nd year course with no requisites.
