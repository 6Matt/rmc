Assignments are the most difficult part, but he's willing to help. Excellent lecturer, but the board notes can be hard to follow after the fact (make your own notes of what he says). Extremely fair, after a brutal midterm, let the class do it as a take-home assignment for 80% credit if you did poorly", "date": "8/16/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "22059486", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PHYS 375", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Was in his Thermal Physics class. Was clearly a professor who wanted to do a good job but didn't know how. He completely overestimated the base knowledge of the students entering the course and many passed using his marking scheme, which was almost too forgiving. Did not feel I learned what was required for the course.", "date": "1/6/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21215081", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PHYS258", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Horrible notes, just equations and does a poor job explaining what he did. The midterm marking scheme was terrible, and did not reflect your understanding of thermal physics at all! You got 3/5 even if you just wrote down an equation, not even the correct one!", "date": "4/8/12", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "20013431", "r_easy": "4", "class": "phys258", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "More than fair in his grading scheme. A little confusing during lectures as he just writes the equations down. If you copy what he says with what he writes you'll be more than fine.
