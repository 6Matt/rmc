Boring.  Still have to go to her class however, because you'll get a far worse mark if you don't go.  Not because you don't know the material... but because she wants to force people to go to her boring class.  She makes you bring a name tag to ensure she knows who is, and who is not there.", "date": "9/12/08", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "14813252", "r_easy": "1", "class": "SOC370", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Going to classes were useless since all she did was read off the slides. Pretty boring class unless she was talking about herself and her personal experiences.

She looks up to Prof Prus and I do not know why because she is a far better prof then him.  She keeps the class interested with group work and provides lots of assignments to bring your marks up.  I suggest taking her course if you have to take a SI style course.", "date": "5/29/07", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "13223259", "r_easy": "4", "class": "Soc238", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
