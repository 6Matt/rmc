Makes his own notes which are a lot more straight forward and condensed comparing to the textbook. Also provide students with problem sets to prepare for quizzes. I took and dropped Freeland's Actsc231 class, Chen is way better! I think Chen is a good lecturer, and works quite hard to ensure lecture quality.

He also is understanding of any problems that may arise (one quiz was WAY too long and after receiving complaints he adjusted the total from 34 to 30)! He has a bit of an Chinese accent but nothing that is too hard to comprehend.
