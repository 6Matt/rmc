Assignment is worth more than the midterm. Final exam questions are quite general in terms of content and thus the marking scheme and marks assigned are quite obscure. Therefore it is difficult to know what and how mcuh should be written This course is quite difficult and is highly NOT recommended.", "date": "1/3/12", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "19660915", "r_easy": "1", "class": "BIOL447", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Good prof, good course. I like the approach to the course- very little memorizational microbiology a la 140 and 241. He focuses on the general issues relating to micro, which is excellent. He can be a little monotone, but the content is interesting and he includes some fun anecdotes.  A solid prof and a great course, even if you dont like micro.", "date": "11/12/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19223676", "r_easy": "5", "class": "BIOL447", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "He really knows his stuff...and a bunch of great stories to go along with it.
