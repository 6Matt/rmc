I agree with others, it's very hard - but he's a great prof. He answers every question. He knows alot of bio! I was surprised at how young he was.

Difficult course content. Very Hard exams! No spoon feeding in lectures, assignments or exams. Alot of work required. I enjoyed the challenge. Extremely helpful if you go to his office.
