Too many readings and teaches all of his classes as if they are a higher academic level than they are. Can be very blunt and come off rude in criticisms of assignments.

The paper was a drag to write but Nick is very willing to help and explain things you don't understand. Only complaint i have is that the readings were very boring and very hard to read and there were a lot of them.

Super super nice and helpful willing to do anything to help someone out! The take home tests are kind of hard because he expects a lot of out them.
