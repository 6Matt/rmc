You can learn so much from him listening to him speak because he is absolutely brilliant.  I felt really challenged in his course, but in a great way.  As a result, I've never learned more in one course.", "date": "3/20/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21431470", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ENBUS 408", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Loved this class!

He's probably the only prof so far who's actually able to keep 200+ students up on a 3-hour lecture on a Thursday night...and it's LAW out of all courses! He's also very cute in class as well...makes us laugh at least 3 times throughout the lecture.

He's very nice and very approachable. He knows exactly what he's doing, and is very clear about what he expects from his students. He has a really good sense of humour, and can get the whole class laughing at least once per lecture. He's all in all a great guy and a must have prof!", "date": "10/13/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19070613", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ENVS201", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Great class!!
