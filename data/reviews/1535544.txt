Prof spends more time talking about herself than the content. Lecture slides are very unorganized, she doesn't really seem to know the content, just rambles off definitions she's reading right from her notes. The reading load is very heavy and her tests are heavily weighted on the readings.

She went off track a lot and went into random tangents. I learned more when at home and went over notes myself. She is a fair marker and can be humours though. I also enjoyed her guest speakers.
