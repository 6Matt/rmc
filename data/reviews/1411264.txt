I have never learned as much in one course as I did in ME597. He was incredibly knowledgeable of all the topics covered, he was very open to questions and discussion inside and outside the classroom, and he was a fairly easy marker. Again, one of my favourite profs during my 4 years at UW.", "date": "3/14/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18276669", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ME597", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I really do not like this Prof. Although his weird and awkward expressions (\"Lovely\", \"This is great right?\", \"Woooah\") can be entertaining, he is not good at explaining the course concepts. He also makes a remarkable number of errors when he is writing on the blackboard, so anything you read in your notes isn't very helpful.", "date": "11/25/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "17818354", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ME360", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
