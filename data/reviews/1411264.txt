His enthusiasm and interest and the coolness of the material made me take mobile robotics as a serious career path. He is from Standford... his explanations are kind of weird at times, but his knowledge is deep and he has lots of practical experience. His notes are amazing.

The course was not easy, and there were many all nighters. BUT you spend the time learning material, not figuring out other profs' poor notes or bad english.

I have never learned as much in one course as I did in ME597. He was incredibly knowledgeable of all the topics covered, he was very open to questions and discussion inside and outside the classroom, and he was a fairly easy marker.

He also makes a remarkable number of errors when he is writing on the blackboard, so anything you read in your notes isn't very helpful.", "date": "11/25/10", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "17818354", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ME360", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
