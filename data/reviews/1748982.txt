There is nothing discussed that she does not put on lecture slides. Her tests are fair, as long as you study the material and grasp it. Her base of knowledge is advanced so a question in class that wants a basic answer you wont get", "date": "11/13/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "20822579", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Law101", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Worst prof ever!!

Probably because of the lack of experience. No emotion, no interest, it looks like she's just teaching because she has too. Definitely avoid this prof especially the 3 hour lecture. Overall class looks interesting, too bad I had it with her.", "date": "10/14/12", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "20701206", "r_easy": "2", "class": "LS101", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "She really doesn't try to keep interest in the class, very monotone and after relentless attempts to stay awake by sitting in the front she still put me to sleep.
