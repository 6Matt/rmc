Exams are a fair representation of the material. Very monotone, but has his moods where he's funny as anything!

He was completely unhelpful and when it came to your final marks, he gave you a completely fabricated mark depending on if he liked you or not.  When students in my class calculated what their exam mark would have to be to get the marks they got, they ranged from 30% to 200%", "date": "4/6/09", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "15612710", "r_easy": "3", "class": "CHE3xx", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Had some funny stories, but classes could be boring a lot of the time.  Assignments usually followed class examples but exams were sketchy and very difficult if you weren't absolutely sure what was going on.

Unlike other boring subjects, this professor does not make the effort of trying to make it a little more interesting. Uses overly complicated terms for explaining simple things. Examples and assignments do not help for the midterm or final. Marks extremely hard and provides little to no reasoning for the marks given.", "date": "7/10/08", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "14649584", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Che320", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Terrible. Picks favorites.  Marked midterm really hard. Told students that 48% is a good mark. Asks to see him, but makes you feel stupid when you ask questions.  Entire class wrote a complaint on him to the department. Assignments do not resemble the exam, most of the exam was theory.
