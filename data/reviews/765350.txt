Tests were fair and straight-forward but not always easy. Go to class for all the test info as well as the vocab and you'll do fine. She treated students fairly and didn't pick favourites in our small class.", "date": "12/18/05", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "11204652", "r_easy": "3", "class": "FR 192B", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "No Comments", "date": "11/27/05", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "10990331", "r_easy": "3", "class": "FR192B", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
