The material isn't difficult and would be interesting if it weren't for his teaching style. He's very unclear in his expectations as well as in his formation of questions. He won't help you with the material or with trying to get a good grade in the class. Highly recommended that you stay away from any of his classes", "date": "4/15/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21540951", "r_easy": "1", "class": "BIOL 377", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Extremely interesting course.
