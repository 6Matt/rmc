She never posted on Learn anything about upcoming events like tests (almost missed a midterm because I was sick and missed the one class where she said when it was). Overall not much work in the class and if you are good with numbers/physics should be easy-ish.", "date": "4/11/12", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "20030247", "r_easy": "3", "class": "BIOL280", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "She is super nice and cares about her class and students a lot. Her BIOL/PHYS 280 has the combination of no work, high mark, and you learn. A perfect bird course to take, yet not a waste of time.", "date": "11/23/11", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "19303415", "r_easy": "5", "class": "BIOL280", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "The material she presents is challenging but interesting. Her tests and exams are so easy, you don't even need to study and you can get an 80! Her classes are very dry and boring, but if you want an easy mark in a physics course take PHYS/BIOL 280 with her!", "date": "3/30/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18332248", "r_easy": "5", "class": "PHYS280", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
