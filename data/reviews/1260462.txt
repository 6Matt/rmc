Nothing he said in class was understood. Not useful at all and very difficult course overall. However, he is a nice guy and he goes VERY easy on you on the final. Do not feel discouraged when study for the final through (because the lecture notes are hard to get. He will ask very easy questions (thank god).", "date": "12/15/09", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "16558366", "r_easy": "1", "class": "Chem356", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
