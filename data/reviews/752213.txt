He has got to be one of the greatest profs to ever walk the face of the earth. Lots of reading (as in 5 books I believe for discussion sessions in this class) but it was all worth it.

It's true, there's a ton of material to keep track of, but its not overwhelming. He's tough but fair as a marker. I never felt shortchanged.
