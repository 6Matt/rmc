He made great accommodations for  me to do 90% of the work at home (because of injuries) and always e-mailed to check up on me.  Classes are organized and fun.

Hard to believe that he was only hired on a part-time basis. Very down-to-earth about art, unlike some other profs in the faculty. He showed you exactly how to do the proper techniques and gave lots of one-on-one help during class, critiquing and giving advice. Genuinely cared about the students and very knowledgeable of the subject", "date": "1/8/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15339500", "r_easy": "3", "class": "Fine120", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
