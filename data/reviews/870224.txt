I found his class to be extremely difficult. He makes you work very hard, which I admire in a prof., and I did indeed try my best. But I found this class to be far too difficult and demanding. At times the grading was unfair even, as he gives no leeway on questions; you need to answer with the highest precision or else...", "date": "1/2/09", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "15307965", "r_easy": "1", "class": "LAT201", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "The class was always talking over the prof, and he never said anything about it.
