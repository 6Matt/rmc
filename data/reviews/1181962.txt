Assignments were very hard, but tests and exam were very fair. Sometimes impatient, but always willing to help and discuss astrophysics.

Tough class to stay awake at night but for some reason I enjoyed a lot of lectures which seems contradicting. I think it was his really dark humour I loved.

Take this with a grain of salt however. I felt like there was a lot of work for this course annd not as much reward as my other courses.
