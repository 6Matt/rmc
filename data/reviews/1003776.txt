The material was very easy, however the prof goes on anger rages and deducts too many marks for immaterial details that don't actually matter. She's too arrogant to help students, and all she does is read off the slides. She also needs to learn to speak English.", "date": "6/8/11", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "18713535", "r_easy": "1", "class": "AFM341", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "I feel that she really does care about her students. Although sometimes she can be a bit arrogant (but she does have the stuff, she's so smart in her AIS knowledge). The course was not hard at all as long as u put effort into it.

She shows off way too much and never admits her mistakes. Very strong accent and speaks too fast at times. The university should require profs to pass ELPE because of people like her.

Otherwise, easy course and nice person.", "date": "9/21/09", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "16197839", "r_easy": "5", "class": "AFM341", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "The stuff she teaches sticks with you, and is actually quite usefull for later courses such as AFM 451 (audit).

A lot of group work, but an A for sure. Most I've learned in any IT class. Participation  10%, Online quizzes 20%, midterm 10%, group projects 20% each, final 20%.
