Doesn't what she wants out of assignments.  Is unorganized and often looks like a deer stuck in head lights when people ask a question.  Gives little instruction on assignments and then marks very tough.  Lets you redo assignments but gives similar grade as first time even if you follow her instructions word for word.", "date": "7/17/07", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "13335001", "r_easy": "2", "class": "Rec420", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
