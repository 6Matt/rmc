She gives decent examples and clarifies the material on the slides pretty well, though I was somewhat bored during the lectures (which more likely has to do with the course itself).", "date": "11/27/04", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "2841652", "r_easy": "2", "class": "CS 241", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
