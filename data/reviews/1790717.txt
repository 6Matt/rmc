Often jumps from place to place in the material, usually making mistakes. Exams were way more difficult than the practice questions. Has mandatory weekly homework that was more of a collab effort than anything. Unfair marker, didn't even finish all the material.", "date": "1/28/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "21301676", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECON221", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "This prof was great! Only thing I didn't like is that we didn't get to all the chapters we were supposed to, but hopefully we didn't miss anything we need for 321. Other than that, he was really good. I liked his teaching style and the way he structured the course. He is eager to help in office hours.

Takes too many questions during lecture, derailed pace. many students found the course very difficult- should have come with a mandatory tutorial. Challenging, MUST keep up. prof is young, inexperienced, couldn't tell when class zoned out, happy to help students after class.", "date": "1/8/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "21231492", "r_easy": "2", "class": "ECON221", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}]}
