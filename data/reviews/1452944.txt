I couldn't bring myself to go to class but you don't really need to go since he posts the ppts online and that's all you really need to study. Midterm & exam are fairly easy if you study all the material properly. Exam had 150 MCQ though!

Easy course in general but made things clear and interesting (would bring up relevant information that isn't tested).

The midterm/final could be better if he didnt include fill-in-the-blank and t/f, which dont really test your knowledge like short/long answer questions would.
