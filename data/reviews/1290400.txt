Course is a ton of work, but you will also learn a ton. You really feel like you have accomplished something when you finish the course. Fair marker, knows she gives a lot of work so she adjusts for it. Overall, I have mixed feelings about her. Good at teaching and knowledgeable, but not easy to talk to, I get a standoffish vibe.", "date": "2/6/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21325629", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PSCI282", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Lectures are not very organized.

Best at the department. If you actually want to learn and be challenged than this is the professor to go to.
