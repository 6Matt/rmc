He gives few directions and when students inevitably stumble, he does nothing to help. Totally unreliable with dates, getting marks back, writing assignments. I think he makes up the course on the fly. He will make excuses for himself and his TAs, but does not fix problems. Very imp. to pick a solid team.", "date": "4/1/11", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "18344973", "r_easy": "2", "class": "PHS609", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "He should stick to his research and quit teaching. He makes up the course as he goes and ignores student questions. For questions he does not ignore, he provides vague answers. He expects you to read his mind, create his assignments for him, and cannot even do a simple task such as letting students know when the final exam is. Completely useless.", "date": "7/18/08", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "14670196", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHSxxx", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Great prof. His exams were completely based on what he said in lectures. You just have to take decent notes and you can get an A. I didn't crack open the textbook once because he'd covered all the relevant material. Makes a 3 hour lecture interesting. (Liked the break too.) Also doesn't believe in useless assignments, which is great time-wise.", "date": "2/27/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "11523210", "r_easy": "5", "class": "CS330", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "He is a fair marker and knows his stuff.
