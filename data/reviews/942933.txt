I like some things about him, but there are a lot of drawbacks. His exams do not test the concepts of the material, rather force you to remember the in-class examples. Not much thinking/reasoning involved, which should be reaquired for a management science course. He is clearly enthusiastic, but also goes over time a lot.", "date": "7/28/09", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "16072464", "r_easy": "3", "class": "MSCI432", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Very enthusiastic prof.
