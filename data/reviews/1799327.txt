Attending class was not really mandatory, but if you paid attention to his examples there was some benefit. DO THE PRACTICE QUESTIONS. Midterms were easy if you study, bell curved ALOT.

Online test- Gives you one hour to do it so it's free marks, don't even have to study for that. The final was hard but i didnt study or show up to class. Classes aren't mandatory but it's helpful.

He makes the midterms really easy and let's us know what to specifically study. He wants to see his students do well, so he'll take up questions in class and bell curves the class like crazy. You can't go wrong with taking his class.

Really wants everyone to do well. Online quizzes are easy if youve read the text and done the problem set. Bell curves midterms a lot even though they are fair and straightforward.

I actually looked forward to his midterms because he would always put pop culture references in them. Really, profs are just like one of us and he's a fan of a lot of the same things we in class are.

Ok his classes are boring and he just reads from the slides but you should go to class because he tells you what the quizzes are on, etc. THe quizzes are hard but he gives you a LOT of time to finish them.
