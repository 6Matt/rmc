If you're taking 109 to avoid harder math, you'll want to prepare either using Google or the textbook.  I didn't use the book much, but a lot of people did, so your mileage may vary. His exams are straightforward, but some problems were misleading to those who didn't prepare.", "date": "11/19/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22344842", "r_easy": "4", "class": "MATH 109", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Really funny and engaging prof, tries to make fun and exciting.

The thing I liked the most about him is that he gave us a lot of extra examples, especially since the courseware has very few. My only complaint is that he fell behind the other sections, and that meant that he had to teach the really hard stuff at the end of the course very quickly.", "date": "12/20/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21132928", "r_easy": "2", "class": "MATH237", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "HE'S A REALLY GOOD PROF.
