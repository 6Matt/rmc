Brilliant prof, who can also teach at the same time. Provides many different ways to get you thinking.

Very smart and keen about coding. His lecture's aren't always the most organized (he had the tendency to do proofs off the top of his head) but he types up excellent lecture notes afterwards and posts them online. I had trouble wrapping my head around the material, but none of the assignments or tests were too hard.", "date": "7/11/11", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18809865", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CO331", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Oh David, what a man. Definitely liked the material he taught, and really rocked a bowl cut like no tomorrow. He was hit or miss with answering questions, but was very helpful during office hours. His level of nerdyness definitely suited the course.

Used every single slide from last year's prof and claimed that he prepared these slides himself after receiving feedback from the class. Zero capability of explaining any concept at all.

He's a great prof. You can tell that he gets really nervous, and sometimes he gets chalk all over his face, but it's cute. His notes are very clear, he always leaves time for people to write things, and he made me want to switch my major to CO. Definitely recommend.", "date": "11/17/09", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "16385792", "r_easy": "4", "class": "MATH239", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Awesome prof!! Great sense of humour. Made the material very interesting and easy to understand. He did spend a lot of time on proofs of theorems. Some of them are useful since they were similar to exam proofs. The stuff he goes over in class is useful for assignments too.

All in all, not a bad prof.  The course itself is one of the difficult ones.

His notes are unclear and he gives the most redundant proofs, which should have been covered in 1st and 2nd year classes. He has poor blackboard organization (often erases the board he just wrote on). He wastes time proving unimportant things like o*n = 0, and then skims over more important ones.", "date": "4/16/07", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "13016933", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CO331", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
