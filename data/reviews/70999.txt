He was really clear in guidelines for what he wanted in written assignments and tests. It is not mandatory to attend class, however if you do and you listen, do the readings and listen to discussion you can easily pull of an A. Unlike many UW proffs, he WANTS the class to do well. He wants at least a 75% for class average!!!", "date": "5/19/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17235482", "r_easy": "5", "class": "REC200", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "He is my favourite professor ever!
