All the notes are hand written on an over head projector.

She tells everyone for the midterm to write in pen. Then when we get it back, people have their questions marked wrong when its right. We approach her and she acts like robot TAs marked this and that they can't make a mistake.

Her notes we're clear, but didn't help with the midterm or final.  The tutorial is a joke, you go and watch a mediocre TA write answers down for 50 minutes.

Her notes are really good and useful for the assignments and studying. This is an easy intro to analytical chem. 25% for four assignments, 25% midterm and 50% final.
