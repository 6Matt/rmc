Her notes we're clear, but didn't help with the midterm or final.  The tutorial is a joke, you go and watch a mediocre TA write answers down for 50 minutes.  Then the quizzes would cover material learned 3 weeks ago so it was near impossible to know what to study. I like Chem, but her teaching style ruined this course for me", "date": "12/19/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18000331", "r_easy": "2", "class": "Chem220", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Her class is a 'sit down and copy notes' type of lecture. Her notes are really good and useful for the assignments and studying. This is an easy intro to analytical chem. 25% for four assignments, 25% midterm and 50% final. You barely need to put any time into this class. If you are descent at chemistry then this class will be super easy.", "date": "8/11/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17502035", "r_easy": "5", "class": "CHEM228", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I love mikkelsen, she's a great lecturer and has very clear notes... just all around a really good job. Trust me, if there is a course taught by her, try to get into it.. you won't regret it. Keep in mind I like analytical chem so don't blame her if the work is boring sometimes (she knows it can be boring too, she'll make jokes about it sometimes)", "date": "7/20/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17433937", "r_easy": "5", "class": "CHEM221", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Her is class notes were great and organized to the T.
