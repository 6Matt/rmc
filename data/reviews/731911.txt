Her tests are difficult, but not totally ridiculous, and you're expected to go to class. Don't show up late because she might single you out about it. Or if you do go late, email her ahead of time. She appreciates that. She is very knowledgable, and believe it or not passionate about soils. Good lecturer.

The midterm was hard but if you do the work the questions are straight forward.  Her classes are not the type where you can wing it and study last minute.
