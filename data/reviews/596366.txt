I found her midterms and finals fair.  I didn't go to that many lectures, because I found she taught very much the same material as the book with a couple of exceptions you need to be aware of for the tests.This was possible because she had such good slides ven though she left some blank.", "date": "4/17/07", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "13025028", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CS486", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "She does not know how to teach.
