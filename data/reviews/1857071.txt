She gave almost 0 guidance on every aspect of the course. As I sit doing the final project, I am reminded that I have not learned anything in this course. Yes, she is a nice person, and maybe one day will be a good prof.

Tiffany is very unclear about assignment expectations. She does not seem to know how to properly balance out assignments (for example, she believes that a ten page essay is equal to a five minute video). She is obsessed about citation format (docks marks for the placement of a period, etc.). I recommend never taking her classes!", "date": "12/3/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "22427167", "r_easy": "1", "class": "SMF310", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Tiffany seems very unsure of herself and she has unclear expectations for assignments. A nice woman but an incredibly frustrating experience, especially the weekly one-page summaries/reading logs. She promised a one-week marking turnaround and almost never succeeded at it.
