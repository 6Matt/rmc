The first assignment was a challenge, but that was also my first \"university\" essay.  The second assignment was brutal since it was a group project and meetings were nearly impossible.  We explained this to her and she graded individually.  Interesting class, a bit unorganized and no real meaning behind lessons.", "date": "12/17/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21095200", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENVS195", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Great prof.
