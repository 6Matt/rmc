He gets so mad that he makes the finals hard, and marks the midterms very hard. He also gives you very subjective assignments, but if the assignment content doesn't match his ideal answer, then you will get a low mark.", "date": "11/29/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22403486", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ECE 290", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Prior to the beginning of this term, \"Electronic Circuits and Integration\" was the course I was dreading the most. However, as the term progressed, it soon became my favourite.

His notes were better than a lot of nano profs. His final will probably leave you curled in the fetal position on the gym floor, sobbing, for several hours. If he tells you that the exam won't be as hard as last year's, he's lying.
