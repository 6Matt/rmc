The content of Business Valuations is quite straight forward. I often feel that the three hour content can be shorten to 1.5 hours. The business valuation exam is always the last in masters so if you plan on going away for vacation this course is to be avoided. Dave has an engaging style and is able to convey concepts.", "date": "5/3/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "20188789", "r_easy": "4", "class": "ACC606", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Very stringent on being on time, otherwise he yells at you. Singles you out in class if hmwk not done. Exams were not fair as they were extremely long and tiresome to write by hand. Students fear him due to his periodic temper tantrums in class. Overall not an easy going prof, does not seem to care about students' success or have love for teaching.", "date": "4/6/09", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "15612701", "r_easy": "1", "class": "ACC606", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
