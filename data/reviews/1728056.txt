This whole course lacked transparency in grading and for some of the subjective marks like participation there was to be no discussion about the grades. He got really pouty and angry at students for no apparent reason and seemed to give up actually teaching the course. Marking scheme very unfair. Bad prof that made the course bad too.", "date": "9/10/13", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "22114831", "r_easy": "1", "class": "AFM 211", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "One of my worst liked professors in AFM. Not only is he quite dry and boring in class but he is so useless and utterly anal about everything. His marking schemes are so strict, and he expects you to hit all the points or else you don't get full marks. He doesn't really care about his students, and it seems like he doesn't even want to be teaching.", "date": "8/12/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "22046177", "r_easy": "2", "class": "AFM 211", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "1"}]}
