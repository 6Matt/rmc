He is an extremely good lecturer who knows his stuff inside-out, and is able to convey it very well. He dedicates time outside lectures to make sure you do well in terms of material and with help in the project. No doubt one of the very best.", "date": "8/22/10", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "17537488", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ECE438", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}]}
