She wants everyone to succeed so much in the course. Her black board skills are lacking, and she makes a lot of mistakes on the board, but that just keeps you on your toes. I highly recommend her.

She has a French accent that is sometimes not easy to understand, and her teaching style is flawed. It's hard to tell whether she's doing an example or explaining a theorem or something. A little bit all over the place. I rely on the text to get through, and it's not a really easy class.
