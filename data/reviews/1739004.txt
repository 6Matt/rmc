She did go a little fast sometimes, which made things unclear (rarely). The tests were fun to do, but I didn't like the assignments. She's helpful outside of class if you don't understand the material. She wants you to participate in discussions, but they don't seem to help with the understanding of the material.", "date": "12/15/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21085039", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PHIL110B", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Approachable, and genuinely cares about her students. Lectures were interesting for the most part. Midterm done on a scratch off card (instantly know your mark). Paper marking - very stringent in terms of grammar and following EXACT specifications (focused to much on English writing and not enough on Philosophy). Overall fair professor.", "date": "8/12/12", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "20567090", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PHIL215", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "She is engaging, funny & keeps classes interesting. The use of iClickers makes attendance a requirement. I found her lectures to be insightful on many ethical issues.
