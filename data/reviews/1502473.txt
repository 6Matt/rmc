The best math teacher I've had, and out of all the university instructors I've had so far, he's been by far the best.  I wouldn't have succeeded in first year calculus if not for this man.

He was friendly, approachable, & awkward in a comedic way. He held lots of office hours & was eager to help. I loved his love for cats and how he would bring up cats in some way in almost every lecture. His lectures & notes were clear with lots of examples. Terry was a great guy with memorable quirks. He will be missed!", "date": "1/6/12", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19681777", "r_easy": "3", "class": "MATH137", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Terry is extremely dedicated and it shows. His teaching is very effective and he makes the theory very clear. The classes are very well structured and his notes are incredibly helpful. He holds a lot of office hours and is very helpful in them! It's a shame that the university is losing him because he got a job at Google(but great for him!)", "date": "12/9/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19447229", "r_easy": "5", "class": "MATH137", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Only my first semester, but still, this guy is one of my favourite instructors!  He's slightly awkward, but all in all that helps things because it makes him seem more approachable.  I went to his office hours and told him I was taking the advanced class the next semester, he lent me one of his books to help get me ready.  Great guy!", "date": "12/4/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19373448", "r_easy": "4", "class": "Math137", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I believe Terry is a new professor but it didn't feel like it. CS was a difficult subject but he was an awesome prof and was super clear, didn't read off the handouts when teaching, and was very helpful. His cat jokes are also funny :P I'd love to have him as a CS prof again.", "date": "10/10/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "19057165", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CS136", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Excellent overall prof. Funny guy and very good at teaching concepts. CS is pretty hard but he makes it easier. Very good at explaining during officer hours. Only issues I had was that he didn't show up twice during lectures, and cancelled office hours (he holds 3) without posting on the CS website that he wasn't coming.", "date": "9/4/11", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "18977750", "r_easy": "5", "class": "CS136", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "He was definitely an awesome prof, making the course so much interesting and fun.

His lectures occasionally have a few jokes and the cats are adorable. What sells me as a student of his is that he holds office hours 3-4 times a week and he is incredibly helpful there.
