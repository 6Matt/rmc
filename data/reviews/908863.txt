Student presentations took months to get through, very boring.  Required \"journal entries\" never got handed back/graded, even ones from the first two weeks.

If there is less focus on student discussion, and slightly more direction from the Professor, students will perhaps be able to obtain higher marks.

Especially helpful with essays; cares about his students &c. He's very good at intertextual relations, which helps a lot in a course like this.

I first took this course to be taught by a legendary teacher named McCormick.  Greenlaw replaced him, and I can say without any doubt that Duncan too will be a student favourite.  I found his classes interesting, though-provoking, and extremely fun to attend.  In fact, his class was the only one I attended regularly.", "date": "12/24/06", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "12677268", "r_easy": "3", "class": "ENGL105a", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Great prof, knows his stuff and is passionate about english literature.
