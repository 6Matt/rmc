It was terrible, the examples given in lecture and the textbook weren't helpful to the assignments which were marked un-necessarily difficult. Think of taking common sense, drawing it out, and being picked  apart for the smallest things. Avoid this course at all costs...It's also insanely boring.

Lectures are clear, and he sets the pace according to the response of the students. Material is fully explained so your are very well prepared for tests; no surprises.

Good luck figuring out what is going on! He gives really irrelevant examples, often go out of point. A big question mark after every class!  Sit in before drop date and see if u can tolerate that..", "date": "12/6/05", "r_clarity": "1", "rating_id": "11067587", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PHIL 216", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "1"}, {"comment": "Great professor with a wacky sense of humor and wants his students to share in his passion for logic.
