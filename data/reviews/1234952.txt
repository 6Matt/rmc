The friendliest professor I have ever had. She's extremely intelligent, and helpful to the point of ferocity. Have a question? She'll do whatever it takes to ensure you get the answer. Her classes are a joy to attend, and my only regret is that I'm graduating: if I could, I would stay just to take more of her classes.", "date": "4/26/10", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "17065151", "r_easy": "3", "class": "FINE359", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "She's quirky, cute, and EXTREMELY intelligent.  Tendency to get lost in her own thoughts and fail to engage in student questions. Awesome prof. if your interests' line up.
