His class is logical, but his  notes are mess. The exams are so hard. Most of questions you never see before. The assignments are hard as well, you even can't finish them by yourself.

Decent teacher, but should put a bit more effort into the course-copied most notes and assignments from previous teachers, but then took out a lot of the useful explanation and made everything more confusing.
