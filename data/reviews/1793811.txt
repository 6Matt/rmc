The professor seemed very interesting and smart. However, I thought that she tried to cover too much content in her slides  as she kept running out of time (cutting down on studies would help). Book review expectations should have also been clearer. Overall, great professor!", "date": "12/20/13", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "22630639", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PSYCH 253", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "3"}, {"comment": "Absolutely fantastic prof, really passionate about the subject (social psych) but also about teaching in general. Cares a lot about her students, she communicated with us and asked our opinion much more than any other prof I've had. And like someone else said, she's worked in person with some of the top people in the field, so she knows her stuff.", "date": "12/8/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "22469768", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSYCH253", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "I was so impressed with H. Bergsieker from day one.  She received her education at Stanford and Princeton.  AWESOME.  She had Philip Zimbardo for a Psych 101 prof.  She is organized and very concerned that students understand the concepts she teaches.  Take this class with her!  I loved it!  This was my favourite psych class at UW.", "date": "11/26/13", "r_clarity": "2", "rating_id": "22394372", "r_easy": "3", "class": "PSYCH 253", "r_interest": "1", "r_helpful": "2"}, {"comment": "Prof Bergsieker is one of the more amazing profs I have ever had. She is a very down to earth person and truly cares about her students. If you read the textbook and pay attention to the studies discussed in class you will do very well in the class. She is very fair with her midterms and wants everyone to do well.
