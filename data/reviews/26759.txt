Experienced & knowledgeable. Always willing & eager to help. But I'm pretty sure he has ADD, so can get off-track. You can tell he has a crazy side, but in a good way. Lectures are great, but he doesn't know how to use a Powerpoint. He basically writes essay in point form on the PP. Then again it makes studying really easy.", "date": "2/6/13", "r_clarity": "4", "rating_id": "21325533", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PSCI389", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "He goes on on tangents.
