The lab is a hefty amount of work (weekly lab reports, pre-lab quizzes, and a final) and can get quite overwhelming at times, but it is very well-organized and reasonable if you keep up.", "date": "4/20/13", "r_clarity": "5", "rating_id": "21570195", "r_easy": "4", "class": "CHEM 237L", "r_interest": "4", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "Best lab instructor I've had so far! So nice and knowledgeable =D. Extremely specific and clear about what should be learned in each lab.

Often comes off as confusing but that's because people don't ever do their work beforehand. Do some prelab preparation and you'll be fine.

Found the instructor to be unfriendly and quite rude at times. Isn't very understanding when you try to explain things to her and will take off your marks even if your lab partner does something wrong.", "date": "2/17/12", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "19834836", "r_easy": "3", "class": "CHEM237L", "r_interest": "2", "r_helpful": "3"}]}
