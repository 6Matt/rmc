Helpful outside of class and both his assignments and his tests are fair. He likes to put a few questions from assignments on the final. The lectures are somewhat disorganized as he tends to jump from one topic to the next without saying so, but he follows the textbook, so it's not a big deal.", "date": "4/10/09", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "15633437", "r_easy": "4", "class": "PHYS441A", "r_interest": "3", "r_helpful": "4"}, {"comment": "Very good textbook.  He gives good assignments and his finals are good and fair as long as you realize one thing.  The vast majority of your final (maybe 75%) will be based on what you covered in the last 2 weeks of class and nothing before.  If you know that you'll do great.
