I'd recommend him cause he's a total sweetheart.", "date": "12/24/10", "r_clarity": "3", "rating_id": "18036557", "r_easy": "5", "class": "AMATH250", "r_interest": "5", "r_helpful": "5"}, {"comment": "This prof is fun. He has a lot of office hours. Taught too much algebra and theory so my attention got diverted but otherwise he is pretty good. Chapter 3 which was oscillator stuff was not taught probably in class.

Avoids writing unnecessary algebra on board, most of the time, and gets 'to the point' of discussions. He really cares about his teaching, and regularly asks for student feedback/input.

He skips steps a lot when deriving equations and sometimes you can't tell how he got to a certain step. Doesn't explain things clearly, just \"does it\". Sometimes inconsistent with his explanations.
