TODO(Sandy): fully automate this

Step 1: Grab the latest exam schedule and get David to copy/paste it
(relatively easy to automate)

Step 2: Run the following replaces in vim
(easy to automate)

:%s/Winter 2013//g
:%s/^Final Examination Schedule//g
:%s/^Exam Section(s) Day Date Start Time End Time Location//g
:%s/\n[0-9][0-9]*\n//g
:%s/Exam removed from.*\n//g
:g/See http.*\n/d
:%s/^.*\sWLU.*\n//g

Note: Now we'll still have (a few) lines of courses with section, date or location broken into separate lines

Step 3: Manually put them on one line (J in vim)
TODO(Sandy): Modify parse_uw_exam_schedule.py to read tokens (instead of lines like right now) until it reaches the next course department.

Step 4: Remove anything that is on a line on it's own with only section # (ie. AMATH 442) (this is probably from courses with "Exam remove from...")
TODO(Sandy): fix parser so it doesn't crash for this case

(Winter 2013): We might have a couple of courses on the same line (I saw ENGL 102B and PSYCH 323R)
